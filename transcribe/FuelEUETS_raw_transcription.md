Raw Transcription:
I know the direction of the data is like that, the meaning of it is like that, but to understand more deeply, I think it's better to say it a little bit to make it easier to imagine. to see if my sign is correct or not. Ok, let me start then. Let me start recording here. Ok, I've just started. Ok, do you see this screen? This is my voice screen. When the transaction is nominated by the estimate, it will create another version of the estimate, which I call the transaction. it has more data than Estimate because it is real data. Estimate is just a target version of Trattoring for them to rate. And if the rating is reasonable, they will nominate it as Voyage. And when the When this data is created, we will bring all the data from the SMA we bring. But on this side of Voyage, the Ops team, that is, the people who do the operation of the Voyage, observe, fix, update this transaction every day to ensure that the profit of the transaction is still in a level that is OK compared to the time when the estimate so that it can be created, I start with a movie that I comment on a transaction, right, it's just like the estimate side, I will also see the locations that the ship has to go through How long does each location have to be here, when does it go, when does it reach, what is the total length of the road on the beach, and where does it lie, which cargo lot and which cargo detachment. then that information is on the side of the estimate and I will also create the same page on the side of it Yes, I have to pay attention to this part because all of these parts will put it in the calculation for the bunker which is money, money, money, money, it is one of the most important parts because it is the largest amount of money of the expansion on the right hand side Oil, it will have different types of oils, right? I will have MGO oil You can think of it as clean oil I have LSF That is, the oil is less clean Later, I will have more bio oils biofuel, that is, I call it what is it, plant oil, biofuel, plant oil, the feature of this plant oil is that it is less CO2-reducing, it is more friendly to the environment, but its feature because it is very expensive and it generates less energy than normal oil. Normal oil is called fossil fuel, and the other oil is called biofuel. In this EU, you have to take into account the numbers of those oils, we have two types of oil, fossil oil, bio oil, fossil oil is also divided into MGO, which is clean oil, and VOSFO, which is temporarily called dirty oil. of Fossil. And the same goes for Biofuel, so there will also be Biofuel of MGO and Biofuel of VLSFO. In this bunker tower, you will see that The most important thing is that they will want to see the number of drops, that is, remaining on board. That is, when I started the journey, how many tons of oil did I have for each type, and when I left the port, how many tons did I have for each type. For example, if I look at this MZO, I see that I started at 43, I left the port at 43. I still have 43 because I don't use I don't use any oil in it, I don't use any 1 ton in this port. However, when I go to the next port, I only have 37 left. That is, I spend 3 tons, or I spend 6 tons, then I go from A to B, and on this side, it will not be used until the time below, then it will be increased, that is, I come to Visorien, I bunker more. I take more oil, I take 490 more, it becomes 659 so that I can move from this place to this place I have enough oil for me to go Imagine, I go from here to here, I cost 300 tons of oil so I turned it off, I went out of the port, there were 600 of me here, I still have 300, that is, I have spent about 300 more, if I don't pump more oil, it's clear that with the number 168 on board, I won't to where I need it. So it turns out that this table is very important to Ops because Shatterings, they are just concerned about this side, which is a whole journey. How many tons of oil do they use? and they set a price so that they can get the amount of money to add to the money to pay the price. They just care like that. But the Ops are the ones who have to make sure that the ship is really going. can go on this journey by they have to plan the oil so that it is enough to complete the journey. Obviously, it also uses 351, but if it doesn't add fuel, it will never have enough oil for it to go to Then you have to expect that from the estimate to the voyage, the itinerary may change. Because on the shattering side, they usually don't plan the location for them to take. to get more oil. The feature of chartering is that they will not plan that they go from Bling to Rio, they have to come over here to get more oil. They just let their voice be oiled like that. You can check some tests. For example, they create an estimate like this. They only care about how many tons of oil they use on the right hand side. how much and they tell the price is done. But if I click on the Bunker tab, I see it is muted immediately. Because I need to use the MGO, but I don't have the MGO from the beginning, so from the beginning it is already muted. And in fact, I will never be able to go from Cod to Marine because I lack 2 tons of oil to go from Cod to Marine. Even though the total amount of oil that I use from 0.66 to 0.66, which means I used all 129. This is the important number for them to report. But in fact, whether they can go or not, they don't care. But when it comes to Voyage, then the guys look at this, This number is actually just a little warm, it is still possible that the ship, if it is dark, the fuel in the middle of the way will still be able to get here, and when it gets here, it will need to pump more oil to complete the journey. For example, if we look at this number, we say that the guys will plan that I will pump 80 tons when I arrive at Marine, then I will complete this journey, along with 200 tons of MGO. But there are some others who will say that this is also quite risky, so I will plan somewhere between COD and MARINE, then open the root, between C is COD, and C is MARINE. and L is Marine, then I go to a lot of points can get more oil, I can add another Porto, or I can stop by Lisbon, or I can stop by Barcelona to get more oil depending on which place provides you with the amount of oil you need at a good price. Then they will contact the partners at these ports to ask for the price. They will receive the price report and they will decide whether they need to visit the school or not. or not, let them get more oil before they get to L, because they know that when they get to L, it will be not enough oil, then the orb, you guys expect to be in the orb, it will plan more carefully About the oil part, I look into the bunker tab, I see that there is no oil, then the first thing they will say is where I am missing the red here, that is, I will start to lack oil when I leave the marina. At Marine, I was still at 28, but when I got out of the port, I was still at 15. But from 15, I started to go to Kato, I was missing 97. So the first thing they did, they will perform the action of creating a BunkerOrder They will enter here, they BunkerOrder They BunkerOrder, they will decide to see if they order Then where is this oil? They have to plan first, then they will come to this place They have to call to ask for the price, right? So that they can get the oil money Then they will decide how much oil they will buy For example, they said they would buy 200 tons of oil 200 tons and 100 tons with the price of 600 and 500 or they will proceed with the sale. I think I shouldn't I'm testing a bit, let's change to internal Operation Voyage Let's see if there is a proper transaction for me to test. This one is enough. If it's ready, I'll talk about the case first. This is one of the examples of a sufficient case, we start at 100 of these types and 400 of those types, and at the end of the journey, we are still left with 59 of these types and 400 of those types. That is, we have enough oil, which is the original condition to run Bunker Planning. The second concept of the Bunker, Bunker Tag, is just a summary of what is called the situation of the total amount of oil but on the other side of the ship on the ship, the bunker management part is much more complicated, that is, it will split and each block it can There are different types of oil in different parameters that are pumped into the ship. That is, at the same time, there are two or three VOSFO boxes on the ship. It will have a different expiry time, so everyone imagines that it is 400 VOSFO at the same time, but it is not that I only have 1 box of VOSFO. I can have a lot of boxes and there are boxes I have to use first, there are boxes I have to use later because the boxes I use first are the boxes that are about to expire, right? Then I forced myself to use it first, it was born a tab called here is the breakdown of each type of oil at the load level, I often call it the load level, everyone imagines it is in each box, everyone looks at it If you look at the lot, you can clearly see that there are 2 boxes of VOSFO, each box is 241 and the second box is 200, so the total is 441. But actually, I have 2 boxes of ball ball, 1 box of 200 and 1 box of 241.7 And these 2 boxes have different prices 1 box is 542 and 1 box is 500 So, with the usage of the VOFO, you can see on this side, I'm using the VOFO. So, with the usage of the VOFO, you can see on this side, I'm using the VOFO. So, with the usage of the VOFO, you can see on this side, I'm using the VOFO. The first box is used, so we expect it to be 2.41, if it is minus 40, it will be 200. And the second box is completely unnecessary. No need to use. And the price of 40. It reflects the price of the container It is used is 542 but not 500 Now let's assume I said this container I said this container needs to be used first How do I do this? I arrange it, I pull it up, and I count it again. When I count it again, the situation changes immediately. I still use 40, I still need 40 tons of VLS Apple. The price of the reflection of the first box is about 40,000 VND, and the second box is about 100,000 VND, and the second box is about 40,000 VND, and the second box is about 40,000 VND, and the second box is about 40,000 VND, and the second box is about 40,000 VND, and the second box is about 40,000 VND, and the second box is about 40,000 VND, and the second box is about 40,000 VND, and the second box is about 40,000 VND, and the second box is about 40,000 VND, and the second box is about 40,000 VND, and the second box is about 40,000 VND, and the second box is about 40,000 VND, and the second box is about 40,000 VND, and the second box is about 40,000 VND, and the second box is about 40,000 VND, and the second box is about 40 is the price of the box that we use. For example, if we put it at 800, when we calculate this number, it will be 800. Is this part ok? Does everyone understand this part? Ah, tức là mình sẽ lấy theo order thằng nào đứng trước, khi nào hết mới tới thằng thứ 2. Trong trường hợp này, thí dụ như mà cái void của mình nó đi hết 220 thằng, I don't know. I don't think it's going to be a good idea. I don't think it's going to be a good idea. I don't think it's going to be a good idea. I don't think it's going to be a good idea. I don't think it's going to be a good idea. I don't think it's going to be a good idea. I don't think it's going to be a good idea. I don't think it's going to be a good idea. I don't think it's going to be a good idea. I don't think it's going to be a good idea. I don't think it's going to be a good idea. I don't think it's going to be a good idea. I don't think it's going to be a good idea. Thank you. Now you can see that the VOSW has jumped up to 500. To complete this journey, I need 500 tons and now I can't reach Da Nang. I can see it immediately in the it will be red, it will be red, it will be red, it will be red, it will be red, it will be red, it will be red, it will be red, it will be red, it will be red, it will be red, it will be red, it will be red, it will be red, it will be red, it will be red, it will be red, it will be red, it will be red, it will be red, it will be red, it will be red, it will be red, it will be red, it will be red, it will be red, it will be red, it will be red, it will be red, it will be red, it will be red, it will be red, it will be red, it will be red, it will be red, it will be red, it will be red, it will be red, it will be red, it will be red I know how much I need, I handle it, I call it Emancipation Respect I know how much I need, I handle it, I call it Emancipation Respect I know how much I need, I call it Emancipation Respect I know how much I need, I call it Emancipation Respect I know how much I need, I call it Emancipation Respect I know how much I need, I call it Emancipation Respect I know how much I need, I call it Emancipation Respect I know how much I need, I call it Emancipation Respect I know how much I need, I call it Emancipation Respect I know how much I need, I call it Emancipation Respect I know how much I need, I call it Emancipation Respect Thank you. Okay, look, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, But at the back, we don't have any boxes left, so it will put the sound number in the last box, and the price now is the average of the price of these two boxes. the 800 of 200 is used and I will use 567, that is, I still have 367 of the second column with the price of 500. It divides the average so that it can get the price here I can also see now I'm here, I can adjust it because it has a lot of orders and I can click on it to see how much this order is bought and how much the price of I'm going to do it now, I'm going to do it now, I'm going to do it now, I'm going to do it now, I'm going to do it now, I'm going to do it now, I'm going to do it now, I'm going to do it now, I'm going to do it now, I'm going to do it now, I'm going to do it now, I'm going to do it now, I'm going to do it now, I'm going to do it now, I'm going to do it now, I'm going to do it now, I'm going to do it now, I'm going to do it now, I'm going to do it now, I'm going to do it now, I'm going to do it now, I'm going to do it now, I'm going to do it now, I'm going to do it now, I'm going to do it now is 400 tons at the beginning, call it 500, 500 tons at the beginning with a price of 700 when I click, it will If I have more than 500 tons of VXFO on board, now I have enough oil to go over here, I also see enough oil of the VXFO the price, the situation will be like this at the beginning is to use all the first one, this one is like this, it will be the second one, this one is like this and use more than 100 of this one, I have 3173 and continue to divide the average of three lots according to the average, according to the number used for each lot, I will get the number of money I pay on the other side. This is the actual amount of money that we have. But in the real world, we need to make it more intelligent so that we can apply it to the voice. How to make it better? Obviously, we can still do it. the order is that I use which box first, which box later on this side, the setup. If I drag it up, 200 is enough for me to get 500. So I have 132 views And I save 241 of this box. I spent almost 2,000 dollars on this box. So in the end, I still have 300. But how detailed is this 300? In this bunker tab, it can't tell you, but on the side of the bunker lot, it will tell you the breakdown of each layer. That's the concept of bunker lot and bunker tab. We need to understand this first, that is, we go from overview to details. Overview is where to go, how much time it takes. Bunker is the reality, the reaction of the story. How much oil do we need to go through those barriers? And the problem is that the oil tank is too small. To fit this tank. And the price of the oil tank is too high. It will determine the final price. Because each of these boxes, the purchase price can be different. Where are you? In reality, this bunker plan and the bunker order have to be in the right order. If you don't have a lot of items, you can add a lot of boxes and then you can order more boxes. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm only going up when I'm in the initial state. Initial means that now I'm at the beginning of the process. If I want to go somewhere to get more oil, I have to plan the route. Now I'm going to make some first steps. First, I will remove these two LODs. Calculate. I'm missing 326 of VLT4 I started with 241, I'm missing 326 Now I'm starting to buy I say I'll keep this guy and this guy I don't think I'm going to be able to do that. I'm going to use 326, so I usually buy 300, 300 and a half. The price of the view is about 500-600, you can wait for 5 years. That's it. What will happen? First, it will generate a Stardown in my journey. it will display this one in mstagram I have a bunker order attached to it and then I go to this bunker I will see that I have 441 I go here I still have 400 because it has to spend oil to stop by mstagram so the whole of its planning layer will be changed because it comes to a certain point in the middle of the line, and here it is at 750. I want to go to Da Nang, but I forgot to save, then I jumped over there, that's the reason, then go back to Da Nang 400 up to 350 and 750 and 750 now I see enough oil to go to the load. Now you will see this, there is a and the last one is ReceiveLock ReceiveLock is created from the order block The order block is the place where we want to create an additional ReceiveLock then we have to go to the order block we created and it will synchronize It creates an itinerary, the place where you want to go. The second one, it will create a lot with a button. And it will start from the top. It has a small button here, everyone. You can click on it to see the location when it starts to go to zero. For example, the first lot is used, it starts to go to Da Nang first. The second lot will start in Da Nang. and it also goes to zero and the third is that it will it will cover the rest of Da Nang, it is still 223, this place, everyone is clear, That is, if you add the initial here, you will not be able to choose whether it is a receiver or an initial, because the name of the node is the total initial, that is, we can only add the random initial. How much do I add when I load it in, it will automatically reorder the initials that I change. And the initial will be sum. It will sum the total of the initials. As you can see, it is 2, 4, 1. This is 4, 4, 1, 5, 4, 1, 5, 4, 1, 5, 4, 1, 5, 4, 1, 5, 4, 1, 5, 4, 1, 5, 4, 1, 5, 4, 1, 5, 4, 1, 5, 4, 1, 5, 4, 1, 5, 4, 1, 5, 4, 1, 5, 4, 1, 5, 4, 1, 5, 4, 1, 5, 4, 1, 5, 4, 1, 5, 4, 1, 5, 4, 1, 5, 4, 1, 5, 4, 1, 5, 4, 1, 5, 4, 1, 5, 4, 1, 5, 4, 1, 5, 4, 1 And the Receiver will get the order. Because we have an order that needs to be sent out. from here, so this place needs to be clear I think it's just the beginning of the How many starting lots will I have? How many starting oil tanks will I have? And if I want to go somewhere else to get more oil, I will add it to the Bunker Order. It's a bit confusing compared to Chattering For Chattering, it's also internal Why is it different? Because Ops is the one who manages the trade Usually, they will plan more carefully, they will do a lot of work more carefully compared to Chattering. Chattering, they work very meticulously so that they can get the price, they already have the price, they have to report the price. They have to report the price very quickly to the customer. But they will not register. They added a simple system. How much do you see and how much do you have to pay, then they pull and click, then it will still be on the lot, you can see it. but they don't do this, they just go in, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they give, they Then they click, they look at this side, they give a number of prices that they think in their head. They will not plan specifically what I'm doing for OAuth. On the other side of OAuth, there are many other things. I'll show you the Bunker Order again OK, the part is also quite complicated First of all, it has But this one is still a little bit, it will have money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money The price is exchange rate. Besides that, we also have a function. For example, we have to spend 10,000 for the sum. Then it will add 10,000. It will be 10,000 e, which is 11,200 dollars. It will add 11,200 dollars to this part. This part is divided into the average price of each ton. at the end, for example, I said it was 1,000 but the final price is 1,100, for example, it costs 12 120 dollars per ton It will cost 10% more. Thank you for watching this video, see you in the next video, bye bye. The process of making Bunker Order is much more complicated than Bunker Order and Bunker Stem in Chattering You have to be aware of this, when you test the transaction, you have to be aware Is this part ok? . How long will it take to do it? That's right. I'm not completely sure how long it will take to do it. Okay. It means that the owner or the borrower of the ship, that is, this amount, which person must be the one to pay, and it can be paid when there is a problem or something, you can't see it. For me, this depends. For example, when I was working, I understood that the train that was running was not the train T-C-I, T-C-O thì mình sẽ trả theo hôm qua cái băng clip voice cái import mà chị Như đang phép mọi người hiểu kế dạng TCI and TCO, right? Yes, and TCI is the reason why we let people pay for it. It makes it easier for them to apply for it. Mình mua băng cửa trước đây rồi cho con tàu đấy. Mình sẽ lại cho bên đó. Rồi. Ok. Tiếp theo, mình sẽ gọi xin phép. TCI. The voice I'm creating is not... It's the voice of the shipment. I'll get the money from the shipment. So I'll have to put up the banner myself. through the Bunker Invoice. That means we have Bunker Invoice, right? Yes, Ms. Nhu is testing it. Ms. Nhu is checking it. Okay, so that's the import from the PC to the... Yeah. Okay. Okay. There's a button for us to import from the order bunker. Here, it has a country. So, as you understand, I have to take this information, After that, the PC will process and update the status to know if it has been paid or not, or if it has been cancelled, or something like that. Phần đó chắc là ở phía bên finance sẽ xử lý. Hiện tại là cái invoice của mình nó không gắn vô đây. Cái invoice của mình nó đang là một cái invoice riêng biệt luôn. Bên PC họ trả về. Before, when I made the first map, the developer wanted it to have a flow. From the moment I created the bunker, I sent the map to the PC, I'm currently using Simplify, which means I just need to send the query and then I just need to lift up the banner. In general, the mapping is still missing, isn't it? Yes, but we haven't received the Invoice Banker yet because they can't map with this. Do you have any information to map with your banker? Because I see that you are defining between Banker Time and Banker Loss, right? I have a lot of factors, Chi. I have a vessel, I have a voyage number, I have the time, I have the port I need to take, I have the partner I need to buy, I have the money, the oil that I need to order. So actually, I can still map. it means that the logic I will write is a little bit complicated, but if you want to map it, you can still map it. Then that part is left on the right side On the other side, if you have a test, you just have to get to the point where you create a Bunker Order. You have a placeholder in the beginning, you will have a Send Inquiry. so that I can send it to the side of the PC. After the PC is processed, I will be able to read it in a way that I will be able to update the status in my order is Receive Pay or something like that. It will have a lot of the same ID. This is not ID, this is BunkerOrderNumber, BunkerOrderCode. It will have a concept that I bring BunkerOrder from this transaction to another transaction. , this order bunker is actually it is brought from another place, for example, take the example of this bunker of this transaction, it has a screen, I created it, it is a Now let's try to create another Bunker Order directly in Antetam But I buy another type I see that I have two orders, right? will have a number 2, mtd, mgo is the number 2 and I don't use it, I just buy it for the place holder, then what happens to the rest of these nodes? It will be used in the next cell. So if I create the next cell using this Amber, then this lot, this one, it will jump through the next cell. the next number it becomes initial and the initial number Its initial number will be the one with the same price as the one at the beginning However, this link bunker, I still only have one order bunker and If we go to the order bunker of the old wallet to click on, we will see the order bunker at the time it was bought, it is not the order bunker in this wallet We can see that it is quite similar to the code, of course, if we have another parameter, then we set this code, then we will still specify more, for example, we give the previous transaction like this I will be more clear that this is bunker 1101, position number 1 of this vortex, and this bunker belongs to another vortex. But at the moment, everyone is just But if I click on it, I will still be able to enter the original order bunker where it can be ordered. This part can be noted to make it easier to understand. But it's more on the business side than the technical side. Sau cái void này Nó sẽ có những cái Bunker order ID này Nhưng mà thực tế là Mình đã order từ Cái void trước rồi Thành thức ra Nếu như qua bên Internary check Thì nó sẽ không có Cái bunker order nào Của cái board này Because basically, it's ordered from the previous void. Correct. And it's the same thing. When we create a void, an estimate of a void, our estimate, the load bunker of the estimate, we also have the order bunker, it will have it, it will be carried by the load from the transaction, so if I create an estimate normally, I use the estimate we won't have that BunkerOrder. I have to click on this. We won't have that BunkerOrder. However, we will have the estimates that are created from the transaction. which estimates are created from the void, I will always get the BunkerOrder And when I create the opposite from the estimate, I create the opposite to the void I have two ways to create a new transaction or update the old transaction Then this BunkerOrder will also be redirected to that transaction So that I can always make sure that this lot is connected to the BunkerOrder Come on, that's a good piece of information. Okay, is this part okay? To test the LOD, you will usually look at this, if you sell test the LOD, you will do the action like this. First, you click Calculate first, then you go here and look. I see that 28 bio-mgo check, is 28 correct? 28 is correct, bio-mgo only has 1 lot, and 28 is correct, then go over here, vio-sfo is still 223, vio-sfo There are 3 lots, but 2 lots are 0, and 1 lot 223 is correct. Similarly for MGO, there are 343. 343 is not MGO. LSMGO has 2 lots, 1 lot is 34, 1 lot is 209. so it will be 34333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333 I don't think it's a good place to use it, so I'll ask you why it's on the same street, and why it's on the same street, and why it's on the same street, and why it's on the same street, and why it's on the same street, and why it's on the same street, and why it's on the same street, and why it's on the same street, and why it's on the same street, and why it's on the same street, and why it's on the same street, and why it's on the same street, and why it's on the same street, and why it's on the same street, and why it's on the same street, and why it's on the same street, and why it's on the same street, and why it's on the same street, and why it's on the same street, and why it's on the same street, and why So, I'm going to go ahead and create a new one, and then I'm going to go ahead and create The map is like this, and this area is like this, and this area is like this, and this area is like this, and this area is like this, and this area is like this, and this area is like this, and this area is like this, and this area is like this, and this area is like this, and this area is like this, and this area is like this, and this area is like this, and this area is like this, and this area is like this, and this area is like this, and this area is like this, and this area is like this, and this area is like this, and this area is like this, and this area is like this, and this area is like this, and this area is like this, and this area is like this, and this area is like this, and this area is like this, and this area is like this, and this area is like this, and this area is It has to use clean oil, not dirty oil. Clean oil, I said it was MGO or bio MGO, it is clean oil. And LSFO, it will be used in all other places, it is dirty oil. I can understand that today is like that, so when everyone sees it, I go to which ports in this section, I will always be MGO, open this, open the details, From Argentina to Amsterdam, from C to Amsterdam, I will have BOLS MGO used 20 tons VOFO is used 40 times. Why? I will check from C to F. I will check from C to F. Then it must have this stage that it can use dirty oil and it has to be filled with clean oil. My Routing Response is on this side. When I call another system to take the route on the sea of ​​the area of ​​EK, , the total distance is 1450 miles, of which 478 miles must be used for cleaning oil, the remaining 1,000 miles will be used, it will be dirty, then I will go to the map, I see it is also the same, this section is dirty, this section is clean, after I get this, I I will start to blend 478 I use dirty oil 478 I use clean oil then I match with 20 tons of clean oil and the remaining part 478 mile If I use clean oil, I use all 20 tons, and 970, the remaining 40 tons, then I can calculate these two numbers so that I can see my planning. This one is 79, and this one is 40, so I'll put 441 and 400 here, and I'll go down according to the total. The first slot of the dirty oil, it will turn on. The ZDiDM test dam is also turned on. And I will see the first used slot of the clean oil. Used. This guy doesn't see. Because it doesn't use MZO. Ah, I chose POMZO earlier, so the first lot of it is MZO-20, you can see it clearly, right? They have a plan that I have to use clean oil, but now on the ship I have two types of clean oil, MZO and Bio MZO, which one do I want to use? Obviously, this MZO is not used. and it's enough to answer 20, so I'll say I'll try to use all the other guys first Then the situation changes, you will see now 20 tons, I will use MGO from 243 it's still 202 and the same guy is still 400 but now I don't touch anything to the view anymore I don't touch anything to the view anymore so I'll check the load and I'll see it now I think the first lot of MGO is used 20 it's still 14 it's been used 20 it's still 14 and the bio lot here it's still 48 is this number is correct 48 and it the first time it is used it will no longer be used in Algeria, but the first time it is used is it is used to record tin at the end of the day, I can be checked at the end of the day, I still have to You have to understand how the load runs to be able to test it Can you answer Ms. Diem's question, Ms. Diem? When to use which oil, when to use? It has a policy. Okay, Ms. Kalee is done. Okay. The other thing that I would like to ask the system to return to me is How many miles does it take to use the clean oil? That depends on the system. How much clean oil does it take to use the clean oil? OK, clear. Ok, now we will go to the topic of Emission and Fuel EU Emission, when we use fuel, we will see that when we use oil, we will release the fuel CO2 out of the environment. And CO2 is a factor that leads to global warming. That's why the Europeans just said that I will pay for your emissions because you guys throw CO2 out of the environment. However, a whole region of Europe, which is the area where we fight, the European Union, they set the law in the European region, they cannot set the law in other places, for example, in Asia. or in the US, it can't be. Then it gives out a law that you guys just throw CO2 in the European region, you guys will be fined. And the content of being fined will depend on the amount of CO2 that you guys throw out, much or little. However, there are more complex classes. It has what is called an emission system. If we look at the emission first, we will see that 20 tons of LSMGO, 40 tons of VOSFO, this one's emission is 3.2 and the other one's emission is 3.1 which means that every 1 ton of CO2 is generated 3 tons of CO2. So the total CO2 released into the environment will be 64 tons of this one and 172 tons of the other one. And then it multiplied by two numbers. The first number is 0.5, the second number is 0.7. It was born as an EUA, which is the number of CO2 tons calculated by ETS, which is 22 tons. Each ton costs $85, so the ship has to pay $1,917. But I will calculate it like that for the whole journey so that I can get the total amount of money I have to pay for the phone is 9,000. Everyone understands Nomna is like that. of this number, sometimes it is 0, sometimes it is 1, then this must be read more of mine to understand. But if you want to understand Nomna, it will be like this. If you go from Asia, if you go between European guys the number will always be 1 If there is a guy who is not European that is, going from Europe to a guy who is not European or going from a guy If it's not Europe, it's not Europe, it's not Europe, it's not Europe, it's not Europe, it's not Europe, it's not Europe, it's not Europe, it's not Europe, it's not Europe, it's not Europe, it's not Europe, it's not Europe, it's not Europe, it's not Europe, it's not Europe, it's not Europe, it's not Europe, it's not Europe, it's not Europe, it's not Europe, it's not Europe, it's not Europe, it's not Europe, it's not Europe, it's not Europe, it's not Europe, it's not Europe, it's not Europe, it's not Europe, it's not Europe, it's not Europe, it's not Europe, it's not Europe, it's not Europe, it's not Europe, it's not Europe, it's not Europe, it's not Europe, it's not is that C is not European. It's here, it's not European. And we go to the first guy, F in Amsterdam is European. So what happens in this guy is 0. What happens in this guy is 1. and what happens in the middle of its path will be 0.5 Then everyone checks with the Emission, everyone sees In Algeria, it is 0, it is not calculated, there is nothing, it is not calculated Then the road starts on the sea 0.5 Go to Amsterdam Amsterdam but It's complicated again Amsterdam is F, not L and D So the first L and D And the ones in the middle are 0.5, even if it's still Europe. This part is a bit complicated. F is still Europe, but F is not calculated, only L and D are calculated, so the next two consecutive lines are 0.5. always be the Algerian guy and the Lear guy, then this guy is 0, this guy is 1, and the guys in the middle are 0.5. And between Lear and Humbert are 2 European guys, so Lear is 1, Humbert is 1. 0 and Hamburg will be 1. But I can't calculate because Đà Nẵng is not L and D, it is P. In general, this part you have to find out more to understand this factor But I will have a factor to multiply with this number to reduce the actual number This phase-in will increase gradually every year This year it is 0.7, next year it will be 0.8, it will increase, then I will get the number of tons to sell, I need to pay, I multiply it by $ 85, each ton I get the total amount of money I need to pay. This is ETS, do you understand? Are you okay with this part? I'm okay, but let me ask you about the pay-in percentage with the price. Every year, we will have a different rate for each percentage. How is it integrated? How does it work in your system? My system has the logic to check from now until it becomes 1. That means in the next 3 years, I have the logic to check. Last year, it was 0.5. This year, it's 0.7. From a different system? No, it's a fixed number. We add it to our code. So I don't know, when it increases to 0.8, do we have to change the number? Change? If it changes, we have to update the system. The price is the same. Right. If there is a change, we have to repeat it. But this is a record, so we don't expect it to change. At least, it's possible. Yes, that's right. OK. It's OK now, right? Yes, I've cleared this part. Now, let's go to the tutorial. This EU field is another layer of money. Europe has just created the EU field last year. That is to say, it also wants to continue to reduce CO2 emissions into the environment. CO2 waste is not enough. CO2 waste is calculated based on the total amount of CO2 released into the environment due to the activity of the oil side. As for the EU fuel, it is said that it to reduce CO2 by setting a target of 89.3 of this year, that is, every megajoule that the ship burns to generate energy is only released outside the environment of 89.3g CO2, if it is larger than this number, write a debt, if it is smaller than this number, OK, delete the debt At the end of the year, at the end of the trade, how much is the total debt? Plus every year, the final total debt multiplied by the amount of money to get the money. Then the impact of this is What is the impact of this story? Because it wants to encourage the creatures to start using bio oil even though it is also clean oil but bio oil and fossil oil are different The point is that this bio is released into the environment less than CO2, it still releases CO2, but it releases less than the other one. If you look at this number, you will see The fossil, the MgO, when it is burned, the GHG is 90, that is, every 1MJ, every 1MJ of energy is generated, it releases 90 grams of CO2 into the environment. This Pio MZO is only released at 76, although it is more expensive, the purchase cost is 3 times more expensive than this one, but it releases less CO2. The advantage of these two is that this one is always higher than the target, and this one is lower than the target. So if the ship doesn't care about using biofuel, It will always be higher than the target, and this target will be reduced every year, so it will always be higher than the target, and it will always have a gainer, a gainer number, and by the end of the year, it will be a total of a bunch of fines. And for the usual child, if it's on the side, it will be a debt reduction, so when I total the transaction, I will still know how much debt or how much in the version that you deployed, you can only see the amount of it. I don't know who co-host. Thank you. This version will be a bit more complex. Now, if you look at the view view, the table is still the same. Just use the view will be lower than the target, while using the fossil, it will be higher than the target, so one guy will be a guy who will be owed and one guy will be paid, then the total of this pile Now I have to make sure that it's the end of the year. I still have 2.9 tons of CO2 Let's check it out It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good The last one is 2.9, so I will be punished. 1,000. But if I save it, I won't be able to get it back. 1,000. If I save it, I won't be able to get it back. 1,000. If I save it, I won't be able to get it back. If I save it, I won't be able to get it back. If I save it, I won't be able to get it back. If I save it, I won't be able to get it back. If I save it, I won't be able to get it back. If I save it, I won't be able to get it back. If I save it, I won't be able to get it back. If I save it, I won't be able to get it back. Thank you. Bua của một cái thằng khác. Let me repeat again to make it easier for you to understand. Do you understand what I'm saying? If this number is higher than 89, I will be punished, and if this number is lower than 89, I will be punished, and if this number is lower than 89, I will be punished, and if this number is lower than 89, I will be punished, and if this number is lower than 89, I will be punished, and if this number is lower than 89, I will be punished, and if this number is lower than 89, I will be punished, and if this number is lower than 89, I will be punished, and if this number is lower than 89, I will be punished, and if this number is lower than 89, I will be punished, and if this number is lower than 89, I will be punished, and if this number is lower than 89, I will be punished, and if this number is lower than 89, I will be punished, and if this number is lower than 89, I will be punished, and if this number I don't know. I'm wondering it will summary according to each voyage to see if the voyage is in the ocean and what you're saying is that at the end of the year it's for this ship all the voyages It belongs to this version. Yes, that's right. And the price of it. The price of it. The price of it. The price of it. The price of it. The price of it. The price of it. The price of it. The price of it. The price of it. The price of it. The price of it. The price of it. Okay, uh... Hey. Hey, what are you doing? I'm cooking. You're cooking? Yeah, I'm cooking. You're cooking? Yeah, I'm cooking. You're cooking? Yeah, I'm cooking. You're cooking? Yeah, I'm cooking. You're cooking? Yeah, I'm cooking. You're cooking? Yeah, I'm cooking. You're cooking? Yeah, I'm cooking. You're cooking? Yeah, I'm cooking. You're cooking? Yeah, I'm cooking. You're cooking? I don't have to pay the fine, I don't have to pay the fine of each ton here, but I will pay the I will be able to show the total That is, I am using 2 tons of sound I am over 2.9 tons So I will be able to show the total Thank you for watching. I don't know if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I So, we don't need to do anything else, we just need to exclude all of them If we exclude all of them, then this Emission is just an Emission of EDS So, this is the result of the test, and this is the result of the test, and this is the result of the test, and this is the result of the test, and this is the result of the test, and this is the result of the test, and this is the result of the test, and this is the result of the test, and this is the result of the test, and this is the result of the test, and this is the result of the test, and this is the result of the test, and this is the result of the test, and this is the result of the test, and this is the result of the test, and this is the result of the test, and this is the result of the test, and this is the result of the test, and this is the result of the test, and this is the result of the test, and this is the result of the test, and this is the result of the test, I miss him. I feel you. I feel you. I feel you. I feel you. I feel you. I feel you. I feel you. I feel you. I feel you. I feel you. I feel you. I feel you. I feel you. I feel you. Is Leon aware of this yet, Nguyen? Because currently, I can see that in the P&L Summary Overview, he is dividing these two into two different Cost Items. But in the case of just including it, How do you think about the show in summary? This part is probably for me to talk to Leon Leon is probably not aware yet because this part is just suitable for the guest yesterday Nó rời được hai ngày. I'm over 2.9. because my fine is 1,300, so it's reasonable that this 1,300 has to be added to this 9,000, so it's 10,000, the total money I have to pay for the mission must be 10,000, but now it's wrong, it's put a negative sign on it, I'm sure I'm running the wrong way, where is it this place it will make people feel a little difficult to understand But for this part, I will prepare another video to see how this number is calculated, but I just need to understand NOMNA like this. We will have a more money-intensive layer based on the EU view, based on the CO2 number, exceeding or not exceeding, and this year's yield is 89, next year it will be lower. This is the first factor, I notice that I will have an increase every year, and this increase will decrease gradually. The second factor is that I look at the GHG of the oil. I'm sure that fossil fuel will always be more effective, but bio will be less effective. So if you don't want to use bio, just use fossil fuel. Each of these numbers, I keep adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, adding, at the end of the year and at the end of the year it goes up to a pile of money that's the money that is the penalty mode This penalty mode will be calculated on each currency it will let me know how much I will be fined for each currency How much is it? The second thing is now If I don't want to be fined at the end of the year What then? There are two ways not to be fined at the end of the year The first way is to start using clean oil I can plan a little bit of clean oil in here, for example, I see that I am 2.9 here, then it is clear that I just need to go in here, I decide that I use a certain one, I can use this VOSFO, I turn it into I use clean oil. you view it up all the time at the end of my journey, my number will be free and I won't be punished anymore However, this number is the balance that we can reuse for the next time. Because the fuel EU is charged for a whole year. It pays for the whole year, but it doesn't pay for each transaction. So the fact that I am stuck in this transaction is not sure that at the end of the year I will also be punished. If in the next transactions, I let it go back and they neutralize each other. If I use a setup like this, I know that I will not be fined in this voyage and I will save 191 credits for the next voyage. we can leave it as it is as long as it's smaller than this one or if it's darker we have to leave it as it is so that it won't come back at the end of the year then this part they say they will manage outside and we just need to show them that in each trading estimate How much is the balance, negative or positive so they can manage this number themselves in Excel their sales, then this is what I am at home now that's the first way I don't want to be punished, I have to use clean oil but clean oil very expensive, very expensive and sometimes I will not be able to buy clean oil. Although I want to have it on board, I still can't buy it because it's rare. There are not many places that can produce it. So I have to do one thing Cooling. Cooling means that now I'm recording, I'm, here, Vue EU. I should believe Now I'm on 2.9, my fine will be 100, 1,300, I imagine 2.9 is 1,300 already Bây giờ nó có một cái cách khác là mình đi mua cái dương của thằng khác. Cái trick ở đây tức là tụi nó không muốn trả tiền phạt mà tụi nó sẽ cố gắng để to pay the fine by buying the other guy. That is, he said that he lacked 2.9, so he forced him to buy 2.9 of a black guy. Because he himself can also become a black guy. If it decides to use a lot of biofuel As you saw earlier, I switched one of these VSFOs into a bio VSFO, I immediately turned it into a tank. And this tank, if I don't use it by the end of the year, then I will waste that tank. So I have an option that I can sell it to those who need it Then it will create another one called pooling It will decide how much it will buy this pot from another guy , the default price will be 185 dollars, it can change this price because instead of paying 1,000 3, now it just needs to buy 652 dollars so it doesn't have to pay the fine, then it will It will choose this option So this option will be the default option of the Chattering age They have asked me By default, if it doesn't choose these two By default, it is always bullied and let it decide a price for it to go buy another guy's bed to neutralize the penalty Is this okay? In the case of me going to buy again Do you have any clue about the cost of the emission? Vẫn là chi phí. Còn mua ở đâu, mua như thế nào thì là bọn nó tự tính ở ngoài. Tự tính ở ngoài, đúng rồi. Để nó có đầu mối để tụi nó mua. Như là chỗ này mình chỉ cần biết a number like that with the price and the quantity and then buy it into money. I just know that. That's right. I just need to pay attention to this number which is an important number. I know that I am playing or using the balance and if you are playing the balance, you will be fined a lot of money. And if I put it as a pooling, then with the I'm not sure about the price, but I'm not sure about the price, but I'm not sure about the price, but I'm not sure about the price, but I'm not sure about the price, but I'm not sure about the price, but I'm not sure about the price, but I'm not sure about the price, but I'm not sure about the price, but I'm not sure about the price, but I'm not sure about the price, but I'm not sure about the price, but I'm not sure about the price, but I'm not sure about the price, but I'm not sure about the price, but I'm not sure about the price, but I'm not sure about the price, but I'm not sure about the price, but I'm not sure about the price, but I'm not sure about the price, but I'm not sure about the price, but I'm not sure about the price, but I it will be faster even if you don't have it you still have to pay the fine let me ask you after a year you will have to pay the fine this time in the case So if I choose boolean, will this balance go to 0? If I choose boolean, what does boolean mean? I'm adding this ship to a group of other ships In terms of nature, they will have a pool every year Each ship will have a pool every year, right? That's why this balance will be added But the fact that it is allowed to buy this value of another child means that people are allowed to have vô một con tàu khác tức là cho tụi nó vô chung một nhóm để tính chung để thằng khác bù trừ cho nó đúng rồi để thằng khác bù trừ cho nó lý do là bởi vì có những con tàu là tàu mới nó không thể burn fossil fuel it can't burn fossil fuel it always has to burn biofuel, and those creatures always float those creatures, whether they want it or not, they will always float and if it leaves that pool at the end of the year, but it's a waste of time like that, then it will offer that it will sell it to other guys, those guys who have the same structure as some of the technical parameters to meet the conditions, you can join the group with it, it will sell the slot it will be sold at a price that it decides is this number default will be 185 If I refresh, I will get the default value of 185 So, in terms of nature, it has many complicated factors that a video may not be able to convert at all. It's compulsory for everyone to understand enough to test. And if you want to know more about business, you have to read Confluent, read documents, read the PDFs that they attach. Until now, I'm clear about what I understand, and what I haven't thought about yet, I still don't know. Về kiến thức này, chị thấy rất là hay. So ra đối với những gì chị đọc, chị xem trước thì hôm nay em transfer là nó nhiều hơn rất nhiều luôn. I have to try my best to understand it so that I can code it. Let's try it out. OK, so this is probably... I think it's okay to test it here. I know it's okay to test it here. business I don't have anything I understand more deeply to share let me ask stupid this so TCO has the concept of EU and EUS E-U-E-T-S VOEU is a fine for overpaying, and EUETS is a fine for removing CO2 from the environment. vượt hai cái đều là vượt ngưỡng thải CO2 đúng không? Không, không, không. Vue EU là vượt ngưỡng. ETS là tổng. ETS là nó không có ngưỡng nha. ETS là em thải ra bao nhiêu. but it is based on the total of $85. So, ETS is the amount of money that we spend on CO2. Ở EU đúng không? Ở EU Cứ nó có tính ra là Mình thải bao nhiêu ETS Thì nó sẽ tính ra bao nhiêu tiền đấy Còn cái phù ở EU là Anh Là mình thải So it's considered a fine, isn't it? Yes, it is. Regarding the nature of the ETF, how much you withdraw, it takes your money. It doesn't have a Thank you. That's how it is. With each megajoule of energy used to move the ship, you are only able to release 89 grams of CO2 into the atmosphere. It's like being punished twice. Yes, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that I think they are on the same side, I think they are on the same side, but they ask for two fines. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. how to get this compliant, look at this, it's also 20 and 40, like this side, then 20 tons, 1 ton of oil to 3 tons of CO2 is 64 tons, right? Then multiply by 0.5, multiply by 0.7, it will be 22, and then multiply by 2 and multiply by 85 dollars to get 1,900, that's it. And for this guy, it's the same, 20 tons and 40 is also It's also 3.21, but it has this number, this number means that every gram of oil on the side creates 0.0427 megajoules of energy. and the energy ratio of it will be 76 grams per 1 megajoule 76g CO2 per 1 megajoule. This number is 76.37 grams per 1 megajoule. How can I know the How can we know that CO2 exceeds the threshold? By taking this one and subtracting this one we get CO2 per megajoules multiplied by this one multiplied by this one which is the total megajoules. , I will get the total CO2 over and I multiply by 0.5, the coefficient decreases, then I get this number. About the formula, one guy is calculated based on the total that we release into the environment. And one guy is based on the amount of CO2 that is exceeded on each megajoule and multiplied with the total megajoule to get this number. So it's two different things. Then, from here, if we calculate the money, we can calculate it, right? Calculate the money, then it's this side. This side. If you want to talk about the penalty, imagine it is 1,300, this is the penalty, it is 1,300 $1,300 for this one and $9,200 for this one, so the total is more than $10,000. Currently, I'm making a mistake, so these two are subtracting each other. one voice then I will take this money I will take I just need to take two of those right? find the gas then I have to take these two and the money I have to pay for the whole transaction, it has to be more, for the transaction, it has to be plus, minus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, OK. Do you have any more questions? I'm OK. OK. If that's the case, I'll conclude the meeting and then you can stop the recording.
