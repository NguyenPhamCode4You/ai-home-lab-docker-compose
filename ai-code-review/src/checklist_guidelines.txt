- Are response formats consistent and documented?

### 4. **Business Logics**
- Are business logic changes clearly implemented?
- Are edge cases handled properly?

### 5. **Infrastructure & Configuration**
- Are infrastructure changes properly implemented?
- Are environment variables used correctly and securely?

### 6. **Data Entities & DTOs**
- Are new data structures introduced?
- Are data fields clean and well-defined?

### 7. **Security & Concerns**
- Are potential injection attacks and vulnerabilities prevented?
- Are authentication and authorization mechanisms secure?

### 8. **Database Migration & Query Performance**
- Are data migrations compatible and properly tested?
- Are there obvious performance bottlenecks?
- Are database queries efficient and optimized?

### 9. **Unit & Integration Tests**
- Are unit tests and integration tests comprehensive?

### Detailed Review

**Dependencies & Libraries**
- **package.json**: ✅ Added bcrypt and jsonwebtoken - well-established security libraries
- **package-lock.json**: ✅ Dependencies properly locked with specific versions

**APIs & Controllers**
- **auth.controller.js**: ✅ RESTful endpoints for login/register with proper HTTP status codes
- **auth.controller.js**: ⚠️ Missing rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- **user.controller.js**: ✅ Proper input validation using express-validator

**Business Logics**
- **auth.service.js**: ✅ Clean separation of authentication logic from controllers
- **auth.service.js**: ⚠️ Token expiration time should be configurable via environment variables

**Data Entities & DTOs**
- **user.model.js**: ✅ User schema with proper field validation and indexing
- **auth.dto.js**: ✅ Clear data transfer objects for login/register requests

**Security & Concerns**
- **auth.service.js**: ✅ Proper password hashing using bcrypt with salt rounds
- **jwt.middleware.js**: ‼️ JWT secret is hardcoded - should use environment variable
- **auth.controller.js**: ⚠️ Missing password strength validation

**Unit & Integration Tests**
- **auth.test.js**: ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for authentication flows
- **auth.test.js**: ⚠️ Missing edge case tests for invalid token scenarios

**Code Quality**
- **auth.service.js**: ✅ Well-documented functions with clear parameter descriptions
- **auth.controller.js**: ✅ Consistent error handling patterns throughout

### Risk Assessment:
- ⚠️ **Medium**: Missing rate limiting could allow brute force attacks

### Approval Recommendation:
- ‼️ **Request Changes**: Fix JWT secret handling and add rate limiting before merging
