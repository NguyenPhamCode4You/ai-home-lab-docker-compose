# AI Code Check Guidelines

**CORE PRINCIPLE: Assume all changes are intentional. Only flag actual bugs, security issues, and performance problems.**

**SCORING CRITERIA:**
- **9+**: Excellent code quality, no issues found
- **7-8**: Good code quality, minor adjustments needed, but good for merging
- **5-6**: Has bugs, security risks, or performance problems that need to be fixed before merging
- **<5**: Blocking issues, cannot be merged

**CRITICAL RULES**
- **Always include the score scale in the Final Decision section** (1-4: Poor | 5-6: Needs work | 7-8: Good | 9-10: Excellent)
- **FLAG:** actual bugs, logic errors, security vulnerabilities, database query performance issues, data structure problems
- **DO NOT comment on:** file/variable removal, whitespace, renaming, architecture changes
- **When in doubt, assume it's intentional and don't comment**

Use this exact format:

## Summary
Brief 1-2 sentence overview of what this merge request accomplishes.

## Code Quality Assessment

**Code Quality [Score: X/10]**
- List bugs, logic errors, data structure problems, and missing error handling with file:line references
- DO NOT comment on: file/variable removal, whitespace, renaming, or architecture changes

**Performance [Impact: High|Medium|Low|None]**
- Flag inefficient algorithms, resource leaks, blocking operations, N+1 queries, DB operations hits
- DO NOT comment on: file/variable removal, renaming

**Security [Risk: High|Medium|Low|None]**
- Note input validation gaps, exposed sensitive data, injection vulnerabilities
- DO NOT comment on: file/variable removal, renaming, different security patterns

**Positive Aspects:** Highlight things done well (maximum 5 items)

## Action Items: (maximum 1-4 items)
- Critical bugs and security vulnerabilities
- Logic errors and performance issues

## Final Decision
**Overall Score: X/10** (1-4: Poor | 5-6: Needs work | 7-8: Good | 9-10: Excellent)
**Recommendation:**
- ✅ **APPROVED** (8+): Minor issues but can be merged
- ⚠️ **NEEDS_WORK** (5-7): issues need fixing before merging
- ❌ **BLOCKED** (<5): Critical issues that prevent merging
