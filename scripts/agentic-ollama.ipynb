This aligns with the business case goals 1 & 2. You can use this to save documents into an alternate system and also create a repository of documents.\\n\\nSedna should be set up with two things to allow this method to be efficient:\\n\\n- 1. Job Reference Tags that are linked to a business transaction (or reference in your alternate system) - for example Vessel Name - Voyage Number\\n- 2. Category Tags that align with where you would like to categorise the Document - eg Certificates, Final Documents, Recap\\n\\nYou will use the Job Reference and its attributes (further detail on attributes in Job Reference section below) plus the Category Tag to be able to retrieve the message ID for download and the information to guide where it should be uploaded into your alternate system.\\n\\n## Workflow\\n\\nBelow is a high level overview of the flow of this use case.\"), Document(metadata={'source': './Sedna.pdf.md'}, page_content='The coloured flow is related to the end user and the grey flow is related to the flow of the automation.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n## Technical Guidance\\n\\n## Event Stream End Point\\n\\nUse the event endpoint to capture real time events. An event is something that is triggered by an action in your tenant such as sending a message or adding a tag. This endpoint is designed to catch events in real time as they occur. Sedna preserves one month of events so actions to be completed based on events should be taken within this timeframe.\\n\\nNote that the event endpoint allows you to retrieve data for specific messages that meet a given criteria in a set order. It is not possible to retrieve messages in bulk in the same order via the API at this time.\\n\\nEvents are triggered on the event endpoint as follows:'), Document(metadata={'source': './Sedna.pdf.md'}, page_content=\"- ● Message received - event.message.received\\n- ● Message scheduled (for sending) - event.message.message\\\\_scheduled\\n- ● Message sent - event.message.sent\\n- ● Message shared - event.message.shared\\n- ● Category tag added - event.message.tag.added.category\\n\\n- ● Category tag removed - event.message.tag.removed.category\\n- ● Job reference added - event.message.tag.added.job-reference\\n- ● Job reference removed - event.message.tag.removed.job-reference\\n- ● Draft edited - event.message.draft.edited\\n\\nIn the situation where you want to save a document to an alternate system based on the application of a category tag, you would use:\\n\\n- ● Category tag added endpoint looking for the specific Category tag ID identified\\n\\nYou would use this to identify the Sedna Message ID for the mail that the tag has been applied to.\\n\\nA n example on how to loop specific message events:\\n\\n- ● Read latest events endpoint [GET] {{baseUrl}}/platform/2019-01-01/event/latest\\n- ● Read the 'next' link\"), Document(metadata={'source': './Sedna.pdf.md'}, page_content='```\\n\"links\": { \"self\": \"https://demo01.sednanetwork.com/platform/2019-01-01/event/latest\", \"first\": \"https://demo01.sednanetwork.com/platform/2019-01-01/event/latest\", \"next\": \"https://demo01.sednanetwork.com/platform/2019-01-01/event/latest?page[cursor]=00001gcrf3et4000000007q5 310000000000g00\" }\\n```\\n\\n- ● Loop on the \\'next\\' links. Check on each iteration if anything has changed.\\n\\nNote - SEDNA plans to implement webhooks for events in the future. This will eliminate the need for a polling loop on events.\\n\\n## Code example\\n\\n```\\npublic function loop\\\\_events() { $loop\\\\_wait = 1; //Seconds //Get the latest event $url = $this->base\\\\_url . \"/event/latest\"; $r = $this->api\\\\_get($url); $url = $r[\\'links\\'][\\'next\\']; //This sets us on the current cursor which we\\'ll loop $last\\\\_id = \\'\\'; do { $r = $this->api\\\\_get($url); foreach($r[\\'data\\'] as $ix=>$data) { $id = $data[\\'id\\']; //If not a new message wait a sec and restart the loop if ($id == $last\\\\_id) {sleep($loop\\\\_wait); continue;}\\n```'), Document(metadata={'source': './Sedna.pdf.md'}, page_content='```\\n//Get basic event metadata $atts = $data[\\'attributes\\']; $time = $atts[\\'time\\']; $eventType = $atts[\\'eventType\\']; //Only deal with incoming messages using the below //if ($eventType <> \\'event.message.received\\') continue; //Get the message subject $msg\\\\_id = $data[\\'relationships\\'][\\'message\\'][\\'data\\'][\\'id\\']; $msg = $this->get\\\\_message($msg\\\\_id); $subject = $msg[\\'data\\'][\\'attributes\\'][\\'subject\\']; echo \"$time $eventType $id $subject \"; } $last\\\\_id = $id; $url = $r[\\'links\\'][\\'next\\']; sleep($loop\\\\_wait); } while (true); }\\n```\\n\\n## Message Endpoint\\n\\nOnce you have the Message ID you can get message information that you need. This is broken down into two pieces.\\n\\n- 1. The job reference applied to the message\\n- a. [GET] /platform/2019-01-01/message/{{MessageID}}/relationships/job-reference/\\n- 2. The documents attached to the message\\n- a. [GET] /platform/2019-01-01/message/{{MessageID}}/relationships/document'), Document(metadata={'source': './Sedna.pdf.md'}, page_content='You can also use this to find the category tags applied if you wish to use them to add extra information for the file path for example, save - final documents, save - recap. This can be done using:\\n\\n- 1. [GET] /platform/2019-01-01/message/{{MessageID}}/relationships/category-tag/\\n\\nOnce you have these two pieces of information you can move onto the next step.\\n\\nUsing the same document endpoint above you would then download the attachments (documents)\\n\\n## An example below:\\n\\n```\\npublic function download\\\\_document($in\\\\_document\\\\_id, $in\\\\_file\\\\_loc = \\'/tmp/sedna\\\\_merge\\') { //Create destination $in\\\\_file\\\\_loc if it doesn\\'t exists if (!file\\\\_exists($in\\\\_file\\\\_loc)) mkdir($in\\\\_file\\\\_loc,0777); //Download the file to the directory given by $in\\\\_file\\\\_loc $url = $this->base\\\\_url . \"/download/document/$in\\\\_document\\\\_id\"; $output\\\\_file = \"$in\\\\_file\\\\_loc/$in\\\\_document\\\\_id.pdf\"; $r = $this->api\\\\_download($url,$output\\\\_file); //api\\\\_download in appendix below return $output\\\\_file; }\\n```'), Document(metadata={'source': './Sedna.pdf.md'}, page_content='## Job Reference Endpoint\\n\\nThe job reference is related to the business transaction so should give you the path to finding the record to upload to.
