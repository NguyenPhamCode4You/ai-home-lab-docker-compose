American Club: Bunker Compendiumii
Foreword
The 2020 IMO Sulfur Cap (as the impending MARPOL regulations are frequently described) has over
the recent past been the source of unrelenting commentary and debate within the global shipping
community. Some of that commentary has sought to enlighten; some has sought to generate
controversy; yet other commentary has offered prognostications ranging from the apocalyptic to the
banal as the full force of Annex VI bears upon the industry as 2020 begins.
Whatever the future might in practice hold following the implementation of the new regime after
January 1 next year, there can be no denying that shipowners and operators have been made well
aware of the challenges the regulations will entail. Indeed, the American Club has been active
over recent months in adding to the supply of information, by way of Circulars and Member Alerts,
on developments in this important area, mainly through drawing attention to the work of various
industry coalitions which have themselves provided their own guidance on complying with the new
rules.
Although a recent focus has of course been the 2020 Sulfur Cap, this Compendium is intended
to supply guidance not only to issues arising from the new regulations but also in regard to best
practice generally in the conduct of bunkering operations. It seeks to provide a comprehensive
approach to loss prevention initiatives demanded both by the new regulations and generally by
supplying guidance on operations and management, both ashore and afloat, aimed at obviating
exposures with both a P&I and FD&D insurance implications. As Dr. Moore and Ms. Anber-Kontakis
note in their preface, this guidance has been supplemented by training animations posted to the
American Club‚Äôs website specifically targeted at seafarers to assist them in the discharge of their own
duties onboard ship in a manner designed to minimize risk of every kind.
My colleagues and I are particularly proud of this document and trust that the Club‚Äôs Members and
other friends across the global shipping community will agree that pride to be justified. In expressing
that sentiment, I offer sincere thanks to those who have labored so diligently in composing this
impressive document over recent months. The distinguished contributors to this notable enterprise
are listed toward the end of the Compendium. Their considerable experience and expertise speak
for themselves. They form the legacy of excellence upon which the exemplary work of producing this
document has been based.
I believe that this Compendium will remain one of the most significant loss prevention initiatives
which the American Club has undertaken in recent years. But even more significantly, it is my earnest
hope that its acknowledged value to the Club‚Äôs Members will stand the test of time, and in itself be
testimony over the years ahead to the great work which was undertaken to produce it.

 Preface
The risks for shipowners and charterers related to the bunkering of ships are broad in scope.
They bear upon operational safety, the potential for environmental damage as well as exposure
to negative financial consequences under contracts for the supply of bunkers. These risks are
compounded further by the forthcoming sulfur cap related requirements contained in Annex VI to the
MARPOL Convention to take effect on January 1, 2020.
Classification societies, marine engine manufacturers, P&I clubs, flag and port administrations, the
International Maritime Organization (IMO), non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the maritime
legal community have issued a significant volume of quality guidance for shipowners and charterers
in preparation for January 1, 2020 as well as general guidance on preventing bunker incidents and
disputes.
The primary objective of this compendium is to provide guidance on shipboard operations and
management, and shoreside management focused on the prevention of P&I and FD&D related
incidents and claims. This guidance is supplemented by training animations posted to the Club‚Äôs
website on bunkering best practices specifically targeted at seafarers to ensure that shipowners‚Äô best
interests are protected, and to prevent disputes.
We hope that this guidance will increase awareness regarding relevant aspects of bunkering, and
that it will ultimately become a useful resource for all involved in this critically important aspect of
operating ships. Members are encouraged to refer to the American Club‚Äôs website at: https://www.

 Bunker Fuels: How We Got Here
From early records of human history, it is apparent that ships and boats were propelled by various
configurations of oars manipulated by men. It can therefore perhaps be stated, not unreasonably,
that the first fuel to propel ships was food; the food consumed by sailors to provide the energy
needed for them to power the oars needed to row a ship.
Speed and/or distance was undoubtedly proportional to the amount and quality of food consumed
but it can certainly be said that since the earliest days of waterborne transportation to the present,
the fuel required has changed from carbohydrate to hydrocarbon!
The natural power of the wind was later harnessed by sail, initially for local trade then bigger ships
with bigger sails to travel to all corners of the world.
Wooden sailing ships grew in size eventually becoming iron-clad, then iron hulled when the steam
engine was fitted to sailing ships then replaced the sails completely as power increased, as did the
size of empires and trading areas and the need for speed. This all then needed a vital resource - fuel.
Eventually, through to the 1950‚Äôs ‚Äúexternal combustion‚Äù - boilers and steam turbines - held sway
because of their ability to burn the dregs of the oil refineries.
But then the diesel engine, first doing its thing with ‚Äúinternal combustion‚Äù in the 1930‚Äôs with
distillate fuels eventually became the nemesis of the steam turbine plant when engineers figured out
how to burn the same stuff in diesel engines that was being consumed in the boilers of steam-plants
which were commonly referred to at the time at the incinerators of the refining industry.
The average 34% thermal efficiency of a steam turbine plant soon succumbed to the diesel plant that
had North of 50% thermal efficiency ‚Äì and now burning the same fuel.
The rest is history, as they say but of late we have seen numerous problems arising from the latest
environmental demands on emissions causing serious conflicts with the diesel engine technology
required to meet those demands whilst consuming the very product that refineries want rid of - and
at times corrupted by unscrupulous disposal of chemical waste that the present day engines cannot
digest.

OVERVIEW
Chapter 1 is a general guide on how to protect ships, their crew and the environment from the effects
of sub-standard and/or contaminated bunkers that find their way into ships. This guidance is further
supplemented by a five-part series of animations providing guidance to seafarers on bunkering best
practices. The animations address best practices generally as well as those specific to forthcoming
requirements under Annex VI to the MARPOL Convention and can be found at https://www.american-
club.com/page/bunker-fuels.
Chapter 2 summarizes three bunker contamination incidents, their causation, damages and repairs
as required, and the immediate costs that were incurred due to the incident.
As an option, shipowners have installed or are considering the installation of exhaust gas cleaning
systems (i.e. ‚Äúscrubbers‚Äù) dependent upon technical, operational and commercial factors to comply
with the lower sulfur emission standards. Such costly investments require careful consideration and
planning. Thus, Chapter 3 provide an overview of the practical considerations for the installation of
shipboard scrubbers.
Ensuring the quality of marine fuel oil has been a challenge for the maritime industry for decades.
The reduction of sulfur content to less than 0.5% m/m will compound those challenges particularly
to ensure bunker fuel stability and compatibility. Chapter 4 is a synopsis of the current state of affairs
and challenges for shipowners to not only meet the January 1, 2020 standards, but also ensuring that
the composition of marine fuels they acquire and consume are safe and reliable.
In 2018 a major bunker fuel contamination incident occurred that affect more than 100 ships that had
stemmed bunkers in the Gulf of Mexico. As a result, the shipping industry and their P&I clubs has
been flooded with off-specification bunkers related claims. Many of these disputes are very similar
and have served to highlight two broad issues:
1.

the u
nsatisfactory nature of charterparty terms which deal with how parties should
manage off-specification bunkers; and
2.

the
very one-sided nature of bunker supply contracts.
Therefore, the ways by which case parties have handled such cases is instructive in a consideration
of how parties are likely to handle similar disputes after the low sulfur fuel era takes effect after
January 1, 2020.
Chapters 5 through 8 provide information and guidance from multiple jurisdictions, including United
Kingdom, United States, China and Singapore.
Members are recommended to contact the Managers, if they suspect off-specification bunkers
onboard. For further guidance and information on issues or claims involving off-specification
bunkers, please refer to the Club‚Äôs website at https://www.american-club.com/page/bunker-fuels
and contact your Managers‚Äô FD&D department, which is available at all global offices, for assistance.

FUEL BUNKERING PROCEDURES
John Poulson, CEng, CMarEng

1.1
 Introduction
It seems inconceivable, certainly unbelievable, that having paid up to millions of dollars for
fuel for a vessel to operate, the owners of the vessel and/or the charterers then should have
to check themselves that the fuel is actually of a standard that complies with regulations and
what they paid for!
The whole concept seems upside-down but unfortunately this is the situation that still exists
when a vessel takes on fuel, commonly referred to as bunkers.
1
 Until such time as there is a
major shift in emphasis of responsibility, we are stuck with a certain regime of sampling and
testing of fuel oil bunkers loaded into ships.
Below, follows a general guide on how to protect ships, their crew and the environment from
the effects of sub-standard and/or contaminated bunkers that, unfortunately, still find their
way into ships. Under any circumstances, all bunkering procedures are to comply with the
company‚Äôs and shipboard safety management system (SMS) as part of compliance with the
International Safety Management (ISM) Code.
Members are also reminded that guidance animations for bunker testing best practices are
available at https://www.american-club.com/page/bunker-fuels.
1.2
 General
Bunkering operations, while routine in many parts of the world, do in fact pose different risks
to those encountered during normal ship operations. Bunkering operations can be conducted
while vessels are at anchor or at a berth and will quite often be conducted concurrently with
cargo operations.
This adds some additional risk to bunkering operations and the personnel involved, for
which additional precautions are necessary. General procedures associated with bunkering
operations are as follows below.
1.3

Ov
erall Responsibility
The Master of a vessel always has overall responsibility for the safety of the vessel and its
crew. But the Chief Engineer has specific responsibility for the safe reception on board and
handling of the vessel‚Äôs fuels.
Responsibility for correct implementation of a detailed bunkering plan is assigned to:
‚Ä¢

the de
signated Person In Charge (PIC) usually the Chief Engineer or the Second
Engineer if the Chief Engineer is otherwise occupied and customarily involving the
Fourth Engineer. In any event, the responsibility falls on the most senior engineer
1 The term ‚Äúbunkers‚Äù originates from steamships which when coal-fired, stored their coal in wooden shuttered ‚Äúbunkers‚Äù in the
boiler room.

American Club: Bunker Compendium2
onboard;
‚Ä¢ engineers of the watch; and
‚Ä¢ senior deck officer.
1.4
 Liability & Responsibility for Fuel Handling & Treatment
IMO conventions place responsibility on the ship‚Äôs crews and shipowners. However, Annex VI,
regulation 18 of the MARPOL Convention also directs responsibilities onto the fuel suppliers
fuel oil quality declaration, via the bunker delivery note (BDN) and requiring fuel oil sampling
at the receiving ship‚Äôs manifold.
Annex VI of the MARPOL Convention also contains instruments to encourage port States to
ensure that suppliers fulfill their obligations. Owners should therefore:
1.
 provide the BDN and samples, certified by the fuel oil supplier that the fuel oil meets
the relevant specifications;
2\. retain a copy of the BDN for at least three years for inspection and verification by port
State inspectors as necessary;
3.
 take action as appropriate against fuel oil suppliers that have been found to deliver
fuel oil that does not comply with that stated on the BDN;
4\. inform the flag Administration of any ship receiving fuel oil found to be noncompliant
with the requirements of regulations 14 or 18; and
5.

a
s per regulation 18.7(f) of the Parties to the MARPOL Protocol of 1997, inform IMO
for transmission to of all cases where fuel oil suppliers have failed to meet the
requirements specified in regulations 14 or 18.
However, despite the suppliers‚Äô responsibilities and the mandatory statutory instruments
available, previous experience from port State inspections indicate that it is advisable for
owners/managers to ensure compliance themselves.
In order to assist ships in ensuring that the operational requirements are met, clauses related
to compliance with Annex VI of MARPOL Convention should be included in bunker contracts,
charter parties and agreements with suppliers, as well as charter parties.
For vessels taking part in a fuel testing scheme, it is advantageous to include a clause
referring to the fourth sample taken at the receiving vessel's manifold as the retained sample
in case the supplier is not in a position to comply with the procedural requirements stated in
MARPOL Annex VI.
1.5
 Implementation
Owners should ensure that there is a vessel-specific 2020 implementation plan on board
as recommended by IMO under MEPC.1/Circ.878, Guidance on the Development of a Ship
Implementation Plan for the Consistent Implementation of the 0,50% Sulphur Limit Under
MARPOL Annex VI. As part of which the Chief Engineer should indicate to the Master the PIC for
fuel oil transfer operations. The Master should appoint the PIC, in writing, either by name or by
position on board the ship. The PIC should approve any change or relief of personnel assigned
to bunkering operations in progress and should inform the Master accordingly.

American Club: Bunker Compendium3
1.5.1 Safety
Announcements through the vessel‚Äôs public address system should be done before
starting operations to remind to all persons on board that smoking on outside decks,
including balconies will be prohibited for the entire duration of bunkering.
1.5.2
 Documentation
When accepting bunkers by barge or shore pipeline, the Chief Engineer should always
check the local supplier‚Äôs documents to make certain that the bunkers which the ship
is to load conforms in all respects with the terms of quantities and fuel specification
which has actually been ordered, either by owners or charterers.
Additionally, a BDN should be produced by the supplier to verify details of the fuel
oil for combustion purposes delivered and to be consumed on board. The BDN is to
comply with the requirements as set forth in Appendix V to Annex VI of the MARPOL
Convention. A copy must be maintained on board to be exhibited upon request.
1.5.3
 Bunkering schedule
The Chief Engineer should discuss with the Master the best possible bunkering plan so
that trim/stability can be calculated to the ships best advantage. Fuels from different
supply ports should be segregated unless this is impossible due to the fuel tank
arrangement.
1.5.4
 Quality and samples
The Chief Engineer should check from documentation that bunkers to be loaded do
not contain any unacceptable amounts of water. The maximum allowable water being
0.05% for gas oil, 0.25% for marine diesel oil (MDO) and 1.0% for intermediate fuel oil
(IFO) 180 and above.
Additionally, the sulfur content of any fuel oil used on board ships should not exceed
values as established by codes and local regulation as applicable, which from January
1, 2020 is 0.5% worldwide unless alternative arrangements such as exhaust gas
systems or ‚Äúscrubbers‚Äù (see Chapter 2) are fitted to the vessel.
1.5.5

Not
e of Protest
Should the fuel supplier fail to provide the BDN, the Marine Safety Data Sheet (MSDS)
for each fuel product to be bunkered as per requirements of SOLAS Chapter VI
regulations and Resolution MSC 286(86), Recommendations for Material Safety Data
Sheet (MSDS) for MARPOL Annex I Oil Cargo and Oil Fuel, should be obtained for the
sealed and signed sample of the delivered bunkers.
Should the Chief Engineer realize that the sulfur content stated in the BDN exceed the
values established by codes and applicable regulations, a written statement should
be issued by the Master. One copy of the Note of Protest should also be maintained on
board to be provided to authorities in case of inspections.

American Club: Bunker Compendium4
1.5.6 Bunkering operations
The Chief Engineer is responsible for the bunkering operations. The Chief Engineer, or
in case of his absence the first or second engineer, must be onboard the vessel during
bunkering and a delegated engineer officer will be in charge while bunkering is in
progress.
The Chief Engineer should also verify the grade of product to be delivered, the pumping
rate and the precise means of communication, including the method of stopping the
barge pumping. It is important when bunkering that each fuel tank should be filled to
no more than 90% capacity or to whatever the company policy may be but always to a
safe level. Furthermore, the operation should be carried out in such a manner and at a
rate to allow the tanks to vent safely.
1.5.7

V
erification of quantities
When the bunkering operation has been completed, the engineer in charge should
ensure that the fuel main manifold is dry and not become pressurized. Although
bunkered quantities can be checked on meter readings, it is best practice to take
soundings of tanks and temperature before starting and at the end of bunkering
operations, especially when bunkering from a barge. The Chief Engineer will verify
then that the quantities taken are those indicated in the manifest from the barge and
the one obtained from calculation, and if there is a difference, it must be noted in the
delivery receipt.
1.5.8
 Sampling procedures
As set forth in paragraph 3.1.1 of the MEPC.1/Circ.875/Add.1, Guidance on Best Practice

American Club: Bunker Compendium5
for Fuel Oil Suppliers for Assuring the Quality of Fuel Oil Delivered to Ships, bunkers are
to be delivered at the point of custody at the ship‚Äôs rail or manifold and is to be drawn
continuously throughout the bunker delivery period. The term ‚Äúcontinuously drawn‚Äù
is specified to mean a continuous collection of drip sample throughout the delivery
of bunker fuel. Sampling methods are further clarified as either; (1) manual valve-
setting continuous-drip sampler, (2) time-proportional automatic sampler, or (3) flow-
proportional automatic sampler.
Furthermore, paragraphs 11.5(1) through 11.5(7) of MEPC.1/Circ.875/Add.1, specify that
sample bottle labels are to contain the following information:
‚Ä¢
 location at which, and the method by which, the sample was drawn;
‚Ä¢ date of commencement of delivery;
‚Ä¢ name of bunker tanker/bunker installation;
‚Ä¢ name and IMO number of the receiving ship;
‚Ä¢
 signatures and names of the supplier‚Äôs representative and the ship‚Äôs
representative;
‚Ä¢ details of seal identification; and
‚Ä¢ bunker grade.
The vessel should collect a representative sample of the fuel being bunkered
from the point of custody transfer (ship‚Äôs manifold). The vessel should not, under
any circumstance, accept pre-filled samples provided by the supplier as being
representative of the fuel being delivered.
The sample is to be processed using supplies provided by the fuel testing vendor.
Samples are to be delivered, the same day, to the ship‚Äôs agent to be sent from the ship
directly to the testing lab.
The testing company should provide kit boxes to transport the fuel oil samples from the
ship directly to the testing company. These kits normally include at least three (3) 400
ml sample bottles, addressed mailers and seals. Prepaid courier airway bills should
be provided to the ships to forward samples. The vessel should provide all of the
information requested by the lab and mail it along with the sample.
Each bunker operation will generate, at a minimum, three (3) samples:
‚Ä¢
 one sample is for retention on board the ship;
‚Ä¢

the sec
ond sample is for the supplier; and
‚Ä¢

the thir
d sample is to be sent to the lab for analysis.
The labels on each of the sample containers is to be countersigned by the supplier‚Äôs
representative at the time of the sampling.
The fuel samples will be thereafter be analyzed according to regulation 18 of Annex VI
to the MARPOL Convention and ISO 8217 and a report will be forwarded to the owners
and/or charterers. The report should also contain guidance on the optimal on-board
processing of the bunkers. For the fuel sample to be properly analyzed, the lab will also
need the following information:
‚Ä¢ date of bunkering;
‚Ä¢

n
ame of the vendor providing the fuel;

American Club: Bunker Compendium6
‚Ä¢ type of fuel;
‚Ä¢ bunkering port; and
‚Ä¢ other bunker quantity and quality information required in the bunker supply
receipt.
Bunkered fuel oil, marine gas oil or marine diesel oil, etc., if at all possible, should not
be consumed until the results of analysis arrive on board.
1.5.9
 Sample testing & analyses
All sample testing should be to the requirements as set forth by the shipowner‚Äôs and
charterer‚Äôs (if and as applicable) agreed ISO 8217 standard. Non-standard, additional
tests may include for those contaminants as listed in Section 4.2 and:
‚Ä¢
 trace metals analysis (nickel, cadmium, mercury, etc.);
‚Ä¢ heavy distillates testing and inspection; and
‚Ä¢ contamination detection and analysis.
1.5.10
 Sample inventory
Samples should be kept in a safe, cool and sheltered storage location, outside the
ship‚Äôs accommodation and where personnel would not be exposed to vapors which
may be released from the sample as well as not be exposed to direct sunlight. A
suitable locker (with opening ensuring adequate air flow) in an adequately ventilated
area of the engine room located at a safe distance from ignition sources and hot
surfaces may be considered suitable. The ship‚Äôs Master should develop and maintain a
system (e.g. log book) to keep track of the retained samples.
1.5.11
 Fuel oil transfers
The Chief Engineer should ensure that all engineers are fully conversant with the
complete fuel oil transfer system, including high/low level alarms and auto-stops.
Engineers should only to transfer fuel oil on direct and clear instructions from the Chief
Engineer.
1.5.12

End of oper
ations
After bunkering is completed the engineer in charge will stop the pump, drain the fill
line, blanking of the hose before passing the hose back to the barge, shore, or truck
station.
All fuel bunker transfers are to be logged in the Oil Record Book (ORB), including start
and stop timings.
At the end of operations, all used shipboard hose pipes (if any) must be drained,
disconnected and manifolds must be blind flanged.
End of operations must be communicated to the Officer On Watch (OOW) on the bridge,
to the engineer on watch in the engine control room and must be recorded in the
relevant engine room log books accordingly.
1.5.13

R
etention ‚Äì documents & samples
As a reminder, Chapter 3, regulation 17.2.5 of Annex I to the MARPOL Convention

American Club: Bunker Compendium7
requires the basic details of time, location, quantity and tanks where bunker fuel is
maintained in the ORB. The ORB entries should be retained and made available for
inspection, if requested, for at least 3 years. Furthermore, the BDNs should be retained
for a minimum of 3 years while bunker samples should be secured and kept for a
minimum of 12 months.
1.5.14
 MARPOL 73/78 Annex VI fuel oil samples (retained sample)
As regulation 18 of Annex VI to the MARPOL Convention requires, every BDN is to be
accompanied by a representative sample of the fuel oil delivered that is referred to as
the ‚Äúretained sample‚Äù.
2
The retained sample is to be sealed and signed by the supplier‚Äôs representative and
the Master or officer in charge of the bunker operation on completion of bunkering
operations and retained under the ship‚Äôs control until the fuel oil is substantially
consumed. In any case, the retained sample must be kept onboard ship for a period of
not less than 12 months from the date of delivery.
Although the resolution specifies that the volume of the sample bottle should be no
less than 400 ml, due to potential need for repetitive testing, testing laboratories
generally recommend that the sample volume is not less than 750 ml.
It should be noted that the practical purpose of the retained sample is to enable port
State control authorities to verify the sulfur content of the fuel, as well as to verify
that the fuel oil quality is in accordance regulation 18 of Annex VI of the MARPOL
Convention.
Annex VI specifies that the sample is not to be used for commercial purposes. For ships
already participating in a fuel oil quality testing scheme, a separate sample should be
taken for that purpose.
In case the supplier is not in a position to comply with the procedural or documentary
requirements as stated in Annex VI of the MARPOL Convention, the following actions
should be taken by the ship‚Äôs crew:
‚Ä¢

pr
oduce a Note of Protest explicitly specifying non-compliance with MARPOL
Annex VI requirements should be issued. The Note of Protest is to be forwarded
to the relevant port State authorities;
‚Ä¢

r
eference to the Note of Protest is to be made in the BDN (if supplied);
‚Ä¢
 if the supplier does not provide a MARPOL sample, the ship‚Äôs crew should
propose their own representative; and
‚Ä¢
r
equest counter-signing and sealing by the supplier. If this is accepted by the
supplier, a Note of Protest should not be deemed necessary.
1.5.15

Thir
d party inspections
Class surveyors, port State inspectors and possibly also vetting inspectors may
scrutinize onboard documentation and records (e.g. sampling procedures, change-over
procedures, engine room log books, BDNs, sample inventory log books etc.), as well as
the fuel oil sample inventory.
2 IMO Resolution MEPC 96 (47), Guidelines for the Sampling of Fuel for Determination of Compliance with Annex VI of MARPOL
73/78.

American Club: Bunker Compendium8
Consultations with port States indicate that analysis of the onboard Annex VI samples
will be carried out upon suspicion, e.g. in case of an accident or near accident.
Testing of the representative sample should be conducted in accordance with MEPC.1/
Circ.882, Early Application of the Verification Procedures for a MARPOL Annex VI Fuel
Oil Sample (regulation 18.8.2 or regulation 14.8), the forthcoming amendments to
Appendix VI to Annex VI of the MARPOL Convention. Based on experiences with port
State inspectors scrutinizing of ORBs related to sludge and oily bilge water inventory
and balance, owners and managers can expect that similar practice could be applied
with respect to high sulfur and low-sulfur fuel movements and consumption when
operating in Emission Control Areas (ECAs), Sulfur Emission Control Areas (SECAs) or
other local or regional port State authorities.
It is therefore advisable that ships‚Äô crews are instructed and trained to thoroughly
verify that the supplied quantity is in accordance with that specified in the BDNs, or
alternatively that independent bunker quantity surveyors are hired for this purpose.
It needs be emphasized that currently, the MARPOL Annex VI representative sample
is only required to be retained under ships‚Äô control and not tested. However, fuel oil
quality testing represents a pro-active approach, both in terms of verifying compliance
prior to any port State control inspection, and more importantly as a safeguard against
the adverse effects of poor fuel oil quality in combustion machinery. Third parties
may also consider test reports from a reputable and accredited independent testing
laboratory as equivalent to additional testing of onboard samples.

 General Guidelines for Bunkering Operations
1.6.1
He
avy weather
Wind. Vessels should not come alongside in preparation for bunkering at anchor
or pier side if sustained winds are at or exceed 34 knots or wind gusts exceed 40
knots. If bunkering operations have already begun when sustained winds reach 34
knots or gusting over 40 knots, personnel in charge of bunkering operations should
continuously monitor environmental conditions and take any additional measures
necessary to reduce risk of injury, vessel damage or pollution, and prepare for
worsening weather. If sustained winds reach 40 knots bunkering operations should
cease and hoses drained and disconnected.
Sea state conditions. For bunkering operations from one vessel to another vessel while
at anchor, operations should cease, with hoses drained and disconnected when waves
or swells reach 3 ft (1m).
Sheltered waterway. The foregoing wind and sea condition guidelines may not be
applicable when a receiving vessel is being bunkered at a wharf or pier in a sheltered
waterway. A waterway is considered to be sheltered when area around the ‚ÄúZone
of Concern‚Äù is protected from the prevailing wind or sea conditions. The criteria for
securing a bunkering operation in these types of locations would be dependent upon
adverse movement of either the receiving vessel or delivering vessel caused by the
prevailing wind or sea conditions.

American Club: Bunker Compendium9
1.6.2 Personnel/safe access between vessels
The delivering vessel and receiving vessel should each have a designated PIC that
oversee the transfer on their respective vessels. The receiving vessel should provide
safe access to facilitate face-to-face communications between the receiving and
delivering vessels for purposes of a pre-transfer conference and other required
communications. The accommodation ladder should be the first choice, but if the
ladder is inaccessible from the delivering vessel, a Chapter V, regulation 23, SOLAS
Convention approved pilot‚Äôs ladder, should be used instead. A Jacob‚Äôs ladder is not an
appropriate means of access between vessels.
1.6.3
 Mooring equipment
All parties should use fenders of sufficient size and type to prevent steel to steel
contact between the two vessels. Mooring lines should be of sufficient size and type to
hold the delivering vessel alongside the receiving vessel during expected tidal, wave,
and wind conditions.
1.6.4
 Tug availability
During bunkering operations in moderate to heavy weather conditions involving
vessels at anchor, tug availability should be considered ready to render assistance
until bunkering is completed, and all hoses are disconnected and returned aboard
their respective vessels. The attending tug(s) should have sufficient horsepower to
maneuver and control at least the delivering vessel involved in the bunkering operation
under all conditions. This recommendation may not necessarily apply to delivering
vessels that are self-propelled.
1.6.5

Flo
w rate, topping off & gauging procedures
Flow rates, topping off and gauging procedures should be conducted in accordance
with the most up to date version of the Oil Companies International Marine Forum‚Äôs
(OCIMF) Ship to Ship Transfer Guide.
3

1.6.6 Watchkeeping
A qualified PIC should be on watch and monitor the bunker operation on the receiving
and delivering vessels of which they are in charge at all times.
A qualified deck officer should maintain a navigation and anchor watch on the bridge of
a vessel that is anchored. The receiving vessel and the attending PIC of the delivering
bunkering barge/tank vessel should ensure the monitoring and maintaining of
sufficient mooring for all conditions as required.

 Introduction
Contamination of bunker fuels that have a direct physical impact upon shipboard machinery
systems is not a new phenomenon. The MARPOL Annex VI requirements for 0.5% sulfur
emission limitation does bring further uncertainty to the industry regarding compatible and
stable low sulfur fuels post January 1, 2020 as further discussed in Chapter 4.
This chapter provides a summary of three problematic fuel case studies and their impact upon
shipboard machinery systems, their causes and immediate costs relevant to the incident and
repair. Any additional costs associated with loss time or disputes with charterers or any other
party are not included.
2.2

C
ase Study 1 ‚Äì Damage to Generators from Contaminated Bunkers Stemmed in the United
States
2.2.1
 Summary of events
In March 2018, a 58,000 gross ton bulk carrier had bunkered 1,300 metric tons (MT) of
intermediate fuel oil (IFO) 380 centistokes (cSt) in the U.S. for its forthcoming voyage to
the Eastern Mediterranean and thereafter, transit though the Suez Canal bound for its
next port of call. The vessel began consumption of the bunkers that it had stemmed 47
days prior in the U.S.
Within a matter of hours, an increase in the frequency of diesel generator automatic
fuel filter back flushes began occurring. However, further incidents occurred for another
10 days when the number 3 diesel generator experienced an issue with sticking fuel
pumps.
The situation worsened over the following five days until the generator completely
failed. Conditions worsened during the three days that followed that led to a dead ship
condition that occurred after failures of the two remaining diesel engine generators.
As per the vessel‚Äôs design, upon loss of electrical power as none of the three
generators were operational, the main engine shut down automatically and that led to
a dead ship condition. The shipboard engineering crew were unable to restore any of
the vessel‚Äôs power or main propulsion.
The vessel‚Äôs Master requested tug assistance as the vessel was drifting. Luckily, tug
assistance arrived on time, made fast on and eventually towed the vessel to an outer
anchorage at the port of Suez. The following day, a generator barge was connected to

American Club: Bunker Compendium12
the vessel to supply required power onboard. Given the size of the vessel and high
winds, at Suez additional tug assistance was required during their period of repair to
keep them on station.
Service engineers for the main engine and diesel generator engines attended the
vessel while at anchorage. From the date of the vessel‚Äôs complete loss of power to the
date the vessel was able to regain power and no longer considered off hire was eleven
days.
2.2.2
 Causation
Bunker samples were sent to the laboratory that showed that the density of the
bunkers was 992.2 kg/m3 whereas the recommended upper limit was 991.0 kg/m3 for
fuel oils with the noted characteristics.
However, upon further testing in the laboratory, it was determined that the dominant
problem was contamination by chemical waste. The higher density of oil also led
to a high concentration of sludge that affected the stability reserve due to a high
concentration of asphaltenes.
The enhanced testing of the fuel revealed the presence of contaminants typical of
chemical waste in the fuel, the nature of which are known to cause sticking and
damage to fuel injection equipment. It was further determined that the fuel had been
stemmed in the U.S.
2.2.3
 Damages, cleaning & repair
The vessel returned to the U.S where the bunker suppliers had agreed to receive the
contaminated bunkers back from the vessel, amounting to approximately 850 MT
stored in the vessel‚Äôs no. 7 starboard double bottom fuel tank.
A portion of this fuel was previously stored in the no. 5 port side double bottom fuel
tank. The vessel‚Äôs managers dispatched a team of shore-based cleaners to attend
the vessel at port of original bunkering to remove the remaining fuel, which was un-
pumpable and clean the bottom of the subject tank to prevent possible contamination
of the replenishing bunkers.
The same cleaning work was then carried out on the no. 7 starboard double bottom fuel
tank. In addition to the cleaning work, the auxiliary engines had random cylinder heads
removed, in order to assess the condition of the cylinder liners.
Figures 2.1 through 2.3 show some of the damages after seizure of the generator fuel
pumps.

2.2.4 Costs
The vessel was out of service for 11 days. Costs of tug assists, cleaning of bunker tanks
and repairs from damages, cleaning and repairs as described in Section 2.2.3 were
approximately US$ 1,100,000.

2.3 Case Study 2 ‚Äì Main Engine and Turbocharger Damages due to Bad Bunkers in Durban
2.3.1 Summary of events
In November 2008, a 10,500 GT general cargo ship had bunkered 550 MT of residual
marine fuel (RMF) at 180 cSt as supplied by charterers in Durban, South Africa for
its forthcoming voyage to Camden, NJ via Dakar. One of the bunker tanks had been
comingled in Durban with 126 MT of the new bunker with 4 MT of bunker previously
stemmed at Las Palmas.
The vessel had just completed dry docking that included classification society
surveys. During the course of the drydocking period, various aspects of main engine
maintenance was carried out including overhaul of the vessel‚Äôs main engine‚Äôs (M/E‚Äôs)
no. 4 cylinder unit (there were nine cylinder units in total), overhaul of turbochargers,
the air coolers were cleaned and partially re-tubed, the scavenge space cleaned and
scavenge valves were checked and overhauled where necessary. In addition, double
bottom bunker tanks had been opened and cleaned out for survey by the classification
society.
During the voyage to Camden, the vessel began consuming the bunker from the tank of
comingled bunker first. Soon after, the vessel‚Äôs turbochargers began to surge and did
so increasingly until the engine revolutions were reduced to 138 rotations per minute
(RPM) while sailing though heavy swell. The turbochargers‚Äô RPM consequently reduced
from 5,000 to 4,300 RPM.
Three days later as sea conditions worsened to Beaufort scale 7-8, a scavenge
space fire broke out in the no. 6 cylinder unit. The vessel‚Äôs M/E was slowed, cylinder
lubrication increased, boundary cooling applied by using water hoses on the unit. Later
the M/E‚Äôs speed increased to 110 RPM. Exhaust temperatures were fluctuating, and
intermittent firing of M/E units was also observed.
A day later, a further scavenge fire (see Figure 2.4) occurred again at the M/E‚Äôs no.
6 cylinder unit and which was again dealt with as previously. The engine was then
stopped and the scavenge space opened for inspection whereupon large amounts of
sludge were found in the scavenge space. The scavenge valves were changed together
with the fuel valve and the fuel pump for the unit.
The M/E was restarted thereafter, but the maximum achievable speed was 80 RPM.
The scavenge temperature was noted to be high from gases due to blow-by. The
no. 6 cylinder unit was then pulled, and the piston rings found seized and heavily
carbonized.
The piston rings were renewed and the cylinder unit re-assembled. Thereafter, the M/E
could then achieve only 40 RPM with heavy fuel knocks from other cylinder units. The
scavenge spaces, valves and air cooler were cleaned and completed three days later
but with no improvement. Fuel valves were tested but it was concluded the engine was
suffering from a general lack of compression.
The vessel was able to complete its voyage under its own power albeit significantly
delayed resulting from slow sailing.

American Club: Bunker Compendium15
2.3.2 Causation
Damage to the M/E was alleged to have been sustained because of consumption of
suspect quality bunkers stemmed in Durban. The charterer‚Äôs supplied RMF 25 bunker
fuel at 180 cSt which was evidently allowed under the charter party, as opposed to RME
25 depending upon that fuel‚Äôs availability. ISO 8217 allows Conradson carbon residue
(CCR) percentage for RMF fuel up of up to maximum of 20%.
4
 This fuel had a 17.2%
rating by analysis after bunkering.
This is an instance of a fuel, whilst being compliant with ISO 8217 produced a very
poor fuel from an ignition and combustion point of view due to the combination
carbon and asphaltene levels; the conditions found in the engine were consistent with
consumption of such fuel. Unfortunately, normal purifier treatment on board would not
rectify this problem.
2.3.3

Dam
ages, cleaning & repair
The vessel required significant repairs including the replacement of turbocharger
bearings, diffuser (stator) guide vanes and other turbocharger associated parts
and cleaning. Regarding the M/E, fuel pump plungers and barrels also required
replacement. Replacement of lubricating oil was also required. Additional costs were
also incurred for additional classification, survey and technical expertise to oversee
the cleaning and repair including the M/E stuffing box as seen in Figure 2.5 and piston
crowns and rings as seen in Figure 2.6.
4 Conradson carbon residue is a test performed in a laboratory that measures coke forming tendencies of nonvolatile petroleum
products that decompose on distillation at atmospheric pressure.

2.3.4 Costs
In this instance, the costs associated with those activities as noted in Section 2.3.3
cost US$ 300,000.
2.4
 Case Study 3 ‚Äì Bad Bunkers Discovered During Switch Over to Low Sulphur Fuel
2.4.1

S
ummary of events
In August 2018, a 31,500 GT bulk carrier had stemmed a consignment of high sulphur
fuel oil (HSFO) fuel oil in Algeciras, Spain on a loaded passage to Newark, NJ. The
vessel departed Algeciras and had sailed to territorial waters without incident.
However, in preparation for entering the North American Emission Control Area (ECA),
whereby it is required to consume bunker fuel with no more than 0.1% mass on mass
(mass/mass) sulfur content. The HSFO being consumed at the time was changed over
to low sulfur marine gas oil (LSMGO). This led to the stoppage of the M/E and loss of
propulsion resulting in the vessel drifting without power.
The initial alarm indicators reported engine control system cylinder failure, M/E
injection quantity piston failure of no. 3 cylinder unit, M/E fuel pump actuator failure
and a M/E slow down pre-warning. Engineers thereafter commenced trouble shooting
the problem under the advice and guidance of shore side managers and engine
manufacturers. Overhauling and cleaning of the no. 3 injection control unit and fuel
quantity (FQ) piston to determine the cause of the alarms was performed that led to the
activation of further alarms that the M/E fuel rail pressure was low and engine control
system fuel command limiter was active. These tests resulted in finding it difficult to
pressurize the fuel and hold the fuel rail pressure under operation using LSMGO.
Twelve hours later, engineers reverted back to using the HSFO and the M/E started
successfully. The engineers then tested the M/E swapping alternatively between the
HSFO and LSMGO for an eight hour period. Thereafter, the M/E was stopped manually
Figure 2.5 \| Main engine stuffing box carbonizedFigure 2.6 \| Piston crown & rings heavily carbonized

American Club: Bunker Compendium17
on the HSFO.
The following day, the crew effected further repairs on the M/E including removing
no. 5 cylinder unit and the injection control unit (ICU) was replaced. For nos. 1 through
5 cylinder units, the fuel oil pipes were removed, their sealing faces were ground to
improve sealing and the fuel oil pipes were replaced to prevent any further leakage
during fuel change over. The no. 1 main fuel oil pump cam follower roller and guide and
pump rack were checked for proper movement.
The ship thereafter conducted various maneuvering tests, but the M/E failed to start.
Two days later, the no. 2 main fuel oil pump was replaced with a spare pump and the
original ICU was refitted to the no. 5 cylinder unit. Thereafter the engine was restarted
and was able to run on full ahead but would not run at dead slow.
The shoreside managers instructed the vessel to start the engine on HSFO given they
had drifted away from the ECA. Upon five miles from arrival distance from the ECA, the
vessel tested the M/E and were tested ahead and astern but failed to start.
The following day, the M/E was stopped and tested prior to arrival Newark and failed to
start showing the alarm condition ‚ÄúMain Engine Fuel Rail Pressure Very Low‚Äù. Following
further shore side managers instructions, the common fuel-oil rail pressure control
valve (PCV) and safety valve were replaced with spare parts, but the M/E again failed
to start. At that point while, the vessel drifted, the shoreside managers arranged for
towage of the vessel to destination at Newark.
2.4.2
 Causation
Laboratory analysis of the vessel‚Äôs bunker fuel detected several phenolic compounds,
naphthol compounds and another compound which are not normally found in
residual fuels. In particular, the phenolic compound, 4-cumyl-phenol, found during
the analyses, 4-cumyl-phenol, does not originate from normal petroleum refining. The
compound has many industrial uses, including the manufacture of epoxy resins and
as an emulsifier in pesticides, both of which utilize the adhesive (sticky) qualities that
4-cumyl-phenol exhibits. Other phenolic compounds that exhibit similar adhesive
characteristics were also found during the analysis.
Microscopic observations revealed that the surface of ICV spindle and distance pin
in the old no. 5 ICU was abnormally worn by corrosion as seen in Figures 2.7 and
2.8, though the duration of its use was only 1,500 hours. Regarding the cause of M/E
starting failure, it is presumed the fuel rail pressure could not be maintained due to
larger fuel leakage than usual after changing over to LSMGO, which is low viscosity,
since the inside parts ICV spindle and distance pin of ICU had been already worn by
corrosion during using HSFO. In consequence, the lifetime of the ICVs were much
shortened compared with their estimated lifetime in normal operation which is
normally approximately 36,000 hours.
As a cause of corroded internal parts of ICU, it is suspected that some chemical
components, which are high corrosive, may be mixed in HSFO, which have been used
for M/E on the vessel. Analysis results by laboratory testing confirmed the suspicion
that contaminants were present in the bunker fuel whereby the phenolic compounds
and saturated fatty acid compounds which are not normally found in residual fuels are
contained in this fuel.

American Club: Bunker Compendium18

2.4.3 Damages & repair
Upon repairs, it was noted that the use of the unsuitable HSFO had led them to
replace any and all suspect parts. For the fuel injection system, the repairs required
the replacement of six sets of ICUs, two fuel oil pump sets, one set of pressure control
valves and a safety valve.
2.4.4
 Costs
In this instance, the costs associated with those activities as noted in Section 2.4.3
cost US$ 450,000.
2.5
 Conclusions
Taking proper precautionary measures as set forth in Chapter 1 and as demonstrated in
the American Club‚Äôs guidance animations for bunker testing best practices are available at
https://www.american-club.com/page/bunker-fuels can assist in preventing and mitigating
such incidents.

PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE INSTALLATION OF EXHAUST GAS CLEANING SYSTEMS
Gareth Burton, Dr Eng
Vice President, Technology
American Bureau of Shipping
Alex Huo
Manager, Technology
American Bureau of Shipping
3.1
 Overview
The International Maritime Organization (IMO) 2020 global sulfur cap requirements come
into effect on January 1, 2020. Common compliance options to address the requirements are
the use of compliant fuels, the use of alternative fuels with a sulfur content less than 0.5%
m/m such as liquid natural gas (LNG), or the installation of an exhaust gas cleaning system
commonly known as a scrubber. This document introduces the regulatory requirements and
outlines items to be considered during the planning, procurement, engineering, installation,
commissioning and operation of scrubbers.
3.2

R
egulatory requirements
In designated Emission Control Areas (ECAs), compliance with a sulfur limit of 0.1% m/m has
Figure 3.1 \| Examples of regional and local scrubber related regulations

American Club: Bunker Compendium20
been effective since January 2015. Starting from January 1, 2020, a global 0.5% m/m sulfur
cap is effective. Additionally, regional and local authorities have introduced requirements
that differ from the IMO requirements. Figure 3.1 below shows the major regional and local
regulations.
3.2.1
 Scrubber as equivalency
As indicated in the Figure 3.1, an approved scrubber system is commonly accepted as
an equivalent alternative for meeting the fuel sulfur limit requirements.
The most common installation is a wet scrubber system with following three option
types: open loop, closed loop and hybrid.
The three scrubber types operate on the same principle: the washwater is injected
into the scrubber tower through the spray nozzles arranged in an optimized pattern
to create a turbulent environment to maximize the surface area of sprayed water in
contact with the exhaust gas. Sulfur oxides (SOx) in the exhaust gas is absorbed in the
water and becomes acidic which is neutralized by the naturally existing or artificially
added alkali in the washwater to form sulfites and is further oxidized to a sulfate.
In open loop system, seawater with naturally existing alkali is used for scrubbing
and discharged back to sea. Treatment of the washwater effluent is typically optional
provided the washwater effluent meets the criteria for discharge in the applicable IMO
or regional/national requirements which includes pH, polycyclic aromic hydrocarbons
(PAH) and turbidity. The system is typically incorporated with an automation system to
adjust the washwater flowrate to make the SOx emission level and washwater within
the required limit when operational parameters change such as increase of engine load
which increases the exhaust gas flowrate.
A closed loop system uses treated fresh water, typically by adding sodium hydroxide
(NaOH) to achieve the required alkalinity, for scrubbing and neutralization. The
washwater effluent will be treated before being re-circulated to scrubber and any
losses made up with additional freshwater. A small quantity of the washwater effluent
is bled off to a treatment plant before discharge to sea, or to a holding tank if overboard
discharge is prohibited. Sludge removed by the treatment plant will be stored onboard
for disposal ashore. For closed loop systems, the washwater circulation rate typically
remains unchanged. When operational parameters such as engine load changes, the
automation system will adjust the dosing amount to the circulation washwater.
In addition to scrubber and associated auxiliaries, a closed loop system will include
equipment for washwater treatment, sludge handling and chemical (typically sodium
hydroxide, NaOH) dosing.
Hybrid systems can operate in either open or closed loop mode as needed.
3.3
 Planning
Effective planning for installation of a scrubber onboard a vessel should consider a
feasibility evaluation, lead time for the supply of the scrubber, scope of structure and system
modification, engineering evaluation and class approval, fabrication, installation and
integration, and testing, commissioning and demonstration of compliance.
The installation of scrubbers typically involves the shipowner, scrubber supplier, engineering

American Club: Bunker Compendium21
company and shipyard. It is important to have defined roles for each party during the various
stages of installation. As an example, the equipment provider may deliver the basic design
and system material specification, the engineering company or shipyard may develop
construction drawings, while the shipyard carries out equipment installation and system
integration.
For existing vessels, the amount of time it takes to retrofit a scrubber system depends on
several factors with the equipment supply lead time and the availability of retrofit yard often
being on the critical path. Effective planning may allow some of the required steps to be
performed concurrently with the possibility for much of the work to be completed before the
ship arrives at the retrofit yard. Appropriate pre-planning can significantly reduce time in the
yard.
Drydocking needs to be taken into consideration if it is necessary to enlarge the existing
seachest, or an additional seachest is needed to meet the demand for washwater for the
scrubber. If feasible, the retrofit activity may be aligned with the statutory renewal survey or
other modification work.
Two major items to be addressed during the initial planned phase are space constraints and
power availability.
3.3.1

S
pace constraints
Scrubbers, as seen in Figure 3.2, are large pieces of equipment. Space to
accommodate a scrubber and its auxiliaries is one of the challenges of scrubber
retrofitting.
Typically, closed loop and hybrid systems are more complicated than open loop
systems. More space is required for the storage of dosing chemicals, circulating
water, bleed-off water and washwater residues. Additional space is necessary to
accommodate equipment such as heat exchangers and water treatment units. The
Figure 3.2 \| Scrubber

American Club: Bunker Compendium22
capacity of a circulating water tank is typically the volume of water pumped by
a circulation pump in 1.5 minutes with 10% margin, plus the pipe volume of the
circulation system. The bleed water holding tank could be a few hundred cubic meters
depending on the duration that the system operates in zero discharge mode when
overboard discharge of washwater is prohibited.
To accommodate the scrubber towers and gas sampling equipment, enlargement of the
funnel is often required.
3.3.2

P
ower availability
Power availability onboard an existing vessel is another key factor to be considered.
Typical additional power demand can be around 1.5% of the rating of the engines the
scrubber serves.
An in-house electrical load analysis will help to determine if the ship‚Äôs existing power
plant has adequate capacity for the additional power demand of the scrubber. The
evaluation is to consider various operation modes of the ship, including normal sea
going, maneuvering and cargo loading/offloading. If it is determined that an additional
generator is needed, the installation of a scrubber may not be a viable compliance
option.
3.4
 Procurement
Since a scrubber system is a ship-specific solution for sulfur emissions, the procurement
process should ensure the system is suitable for the vessel needs. This should consider the
operating profile of the candidate vessel. Key items to be addressed are:
‚Ä¢

T
echnical limitations and operational restrictions
‚Ä¢
Emi
ssion monitoring technology
‚Ä¢
 Footprint and weight
‚Ä¢

P
ower requirement under all operating conditions
‚Ä¢

M
aterials of scrubber chamber and accessory components/systems
‚Ä¢
 Regulatory approval status
‚Ä¢

R
edundancy and worldwide service availability
3.5
 Engineering
Key considerations to be addressed during the engineering phase include material suitability,
backpressure and handling sludge arrangements.
3.5.1
 Materials
The materials used in the construction of the scrubber and the accessory components
are important for the reliability and durability of the system. They should be suitable
for the potential high temperatures and corrosive operational conditions.
Table 3.1 summarizes typical materials for different systems, equipment and components.

Valves (exhaust, bypass, isolation)Nickel alloys
3.5.2
 Backpressure
The installation of a scrubber may impact the operation of the engine if excessive
exhaust backpressure is generated. It is important to verify during the evaluation
of a candidate scrubber system that the backpressure is within the limits set by the
engine manufacturer. Increase of exhaust backpressure may result in additional fuel
consumption due to lower turbocharger efficiency, increased component temperatures,
and cause increased wear. In addition, nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission may be
increased. Exhaust gas fans may be used at the scrubber outlet to compensate for
any additional backpressure, however the addition of more equipment increases the
required maintenance over the life of the system.
3.5.3
 Integration & safety measures
Multi-inlet scrubbers are typically installed so one scrubber can serve multiple engines
and boilers. Such integrated systems require isolation and bypass arrangements so
that any engine
not in operation
can be isolated, or
in case of scrubber
failure, the
scrubber can be
bypassed if they
are not designed
for operation in
a dry condition.
As illustrated in
Figure 3.3, the
isolation valve (tag
no. 7) and bypass
valve (tag no. 6)
should not both
closed, otherwise,
Figure 3.3 \| Scrubber

American Club: Bunker Compendium24
the excessive backpressure may cause the engine to stall. A proper control logic and
interlock arrangement should be provided.
The scrubber system design is to consider any abnormal condition that may occur
during the operation, for example, excessive high temperature, lack of washwater or
potential of scrubber flooding. Automatic shutdown should be incorporated in the
monitoring and control system as a safety measure.
3.5.4

Sludg
e handling
For closed loop or hybrid systems, sludge will be generated from the washwater
treatment system. As set forth in the IMO Guidelines for Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems,
MEPC.259(68), such sludge is not to be discharged to sea or incinerated onboard.
Figure 3.4 \| Outline of exhaust gas cleaning system approval scheme

Typical tanks of 0.5 to 1 cubic meter per megawatt (MW) of engine power are specified.
A sludge dewatering system may be provided to dry the sludge and minimize the
volume, eliminating the need for a sludge tank on board. Sludge can be stored in
Intermediate Bulk Containers (IBC) or barrels and transferred ashore.
3.5.5
 Classification & statutory approval
A scrubber system requires approval from both a statutory and class perspective and
includes the review of the equipment as well as the review of the onboard installation.
From a statutory perspective, the MEPC.259(68), 2015 Guideline for Exhaust Gas
Cleaning Systems, outline the process including approval Scheme A (unit certification
with parameter and emission checks) and Scheme B (continuous emission monitoring
with parameter checks) systems as shown in Figure 2.4. Scheme B is typically used for
the approval of scrubber installations on both new construction and retrofit projects.
Compliance with the SOx emission limit is through in-service continuous monitoring
of the sulfur dioxide/carbon dioxide (SO2/CO2) ratio in the exhaust gas, and the
condition of discharged washwater.
Upon satisfactory initial survey of the installation, and verification of the performance
of the monitoring system, with the concurrence of the flag Administration, the scrubber
will be included in the Supplement to the International Air Pollution Prevention (IAPP)
certificate as the equivalent means for meeting fuel sulfur limit requirements.
The flag Administration is to notify their acceptance to the IMO for inclusion in the IMO
Global Integrated Shipping Information System (GISIS) database, as found at gisis.imo.
org, for each ship-specific approval.
From a classification society perspective, the requirements in the ABS Guide for
Exhaust Emission Abatement related to the safety aspects of the system include:
‚Ä¢

onfiguration and vessel integration;
‚Ä¢
 exhaust by-pass arrangement;

el

‚Ä¢

pipin

‚Ä¢

‚Ä¢

s
afety shutdown.
3.6
 Installation
For existing vessels, preparation for installation can be completed onboard while the vessel is
in operation, onshore before the vessel arrives at the yard, or when the vessel is in the yard.
The work onboard will typically require modifications to the structure, electrical and piping
systems.
3.6.1

Onbo
ard preparation
Some preparation work onboard may be carried out while the vessel is in operation.
This includes the installation of piping, cabling and foundations for seawater pumps
as shown in Figure 3.5 and sealing air fans that are used to provide air to the space

American Club: Bunker Compendium26
between valve discs of an isolation
valve or bypass valve as seen in
Figure 3.3 to prevent gas leakage
from coming to idle engine. This can
help reduce the time required for
retrofitting at the yard.
3.6.2
 On shore preparation
Typically, when a new funnel block
is required, it is common practice to
have the block constructed with the
scrubber and associated piping and
electrical installed within the new
block. Piping for the engine room can
be prefabricated for installation.
3.6.3
 Work in dry dock & at quayside
The additional water demand for scrubber systems may require the existing seachest to
be enlarged, or an additional seachest to be added. In such cases, dry docking may be
necessary.
Integration of the scrubber system with the shipboard system include the exhaust
piping system and the control and monitoring system. The control and monitoring
panel is typically installed close to the engine control station. Depending on the
scrubber system, an engine load signal may be needed as input to the scrubber system
for adjusting the washwater flowrate through variable frequency driving (VFD) pump or
throttling valve in washwater supply line.
Due to the corrosive nature of washwater effluent, FRP (or other similar material)
is commonly used. Plastic pipe connection work should be in accordance with the
manufacturer‚Äôs installation guidelines and carried out onboard by qualified personnel.
3.6.4
 Structure
Structural modification associated with scrubber retrofitting is typically related to
creating the space needed for the scrubber system‚Äôs installation. Commonly, the
funnel requires modification to accommodate the scrubber and the associated exhaust
bypass pipes. Equipment, piping and ventilation ducts may need to be rearranged for
the installation of accessory equipment/system. For closed loop systems, additional
required storage space may take up some cargo space.
3.6.5
 Electrical
In addition to electric load analysis, an electrical coordination study and short circuit
analysis to verify the integrity of the power supply system may be needed.
3.6.6

Pipin
g and seachest
Piping modification involves sea chest enlargement or adding additional sea chest if
existing sea chest cannot meet the water demand of the scrubber system. Overboard
discharge for washwater will need to be added. The pipe between overboard discharge
Figure 3.5 \| Seawater pumps for scrubber system in

American Club: Bunker Compendium27
valves and the side shell need to be of metallic material as required by class rules. This
pipe could be subject to severe corrosive effluent. Carbon steel with plastic lining or
high-grade stainless steel should be considered.
3.6.7
 Stability
Stability and lightship weight need to be evaluated due to the additional weight of the
scrubber system. In general, if the change in lightship displacement exceeds 2% of
the lightship displacement from the most recent approved lightship data and/or the
change in lightship Longitudinal Center of Gravity (LCG), relative to the most recent
approved lightship data, exceeds 1.0% of the Length Between Perpendiculars (LBP), a
stability test may be required on the vessel and stability calculations would need to be
revised to indicate the changes.
3.7
 Commissioning
Commissioning of a scrubber system includes calibration of the monitoring and control
system, functional testing, and performance evaluation of the complete system. Crew training
may also be conducted during the system commissioning phase.
Commissioning can be time consuming. One option is to separate the commissioning and
installation process. Once installation in the yard is completed, the ship may return for
service with commissioning planned in the future. This can help to decrease the off-hire time.
Arrangements would need to be made to ensure the vessel was operated in compliance during
the interim period.
Preparation for commissioning should consider:
‚Ä¢
 development and review of a test plan by the classification society;
‚Ä¢
onbo
ard verification of the monitoring and control system sensors. These sensors
should be preset at the manufacturer‚Äôs plant; however, they may require some
calibration once the system is installed onboard the vessel, such as zero and span
calibration to confirm gas analyzers;
‚Ä¢

av
ailability of fuel with the sulfur content corresponding to the design sulfur limit of the
scrubber system for performance evaluation; and
‚Ä¢

av
ailability of the sampling kit for the washwater effluent, typically provided by the
testing laboratory.
Functional testing is to be carried out to verify the integrity and operability of the system
including the control, monitoring, alarm and safety system. This includes the interlock
arrangement on the exhaust pipes bypassing the scrubber.
Performance testing will involve testing at quay side and during sea trials. Although not
required for the Scheme B approval approach under the IMO Guidelines, many owners/
operators have chosen to carry out testing to evaluate the performance before the scrubber
system is put into operation. This includes the measurement of the SO2 to CO2 ratio, and the
properties of washwater including pH, PAH, turbidity and nitrates.
The test for emission limit verification can be time consuming. Section 4.3.6 of the IMO
Guidelines require the test to be done for at least 4 engine load points. At each load
point, it may take proximately 20 to 30 minutes to get the load steady, and an additional

American Club: Bunker Compendium28
10 to 15 minutes to get the stabilized reading on the emission monitor. Scrubber system
commissioning has taken two to three days during sea trials for some past projects.
The accuracy of the emission monitor may be validated by testing the exhaust gas sampled at
the exhaust stack with a portable analyzer.
The pH value of washwater could be measured 4 meters from overboard discharge at quay
side when the vessel is stationary with generator engines in operation. The corresponding
pH value measured at overboard discharge is set as the minimum pH limit. Alternatively, the
pH limit monitored at the overboard may also be determined by calculation method following
IMO Guideline criteria. This is the IMO approach. For U.S. Environmental Protection Agency‚Äôs
(EPA‚Äôs) requirements, the pH value needs to be measured at the overboard discharge.

3.8.1

M
anning and crew intervention
In service operation planning should consider manning and crew intervention,
demonstration of compliance, contingency measures, maintenance and repair, and
calibration of instrumentation.

American Club: Bunker Compendium29
Designated crew need to be assigned responsibility for the operation of the scrubber
system, however they do not need to be dedicated. Crew intervention will typically only
be required during the start-up and shutdown of the scrubber system, or in the case
of a hybrid system, when switching between open and closed loop. This is generally
a one-push button task. Crew intervention will also be necessary whenever an alarm
condition occurs. It is important that the responsible crew is aware of the operation
limitation and able to interpret the alarm conditions, such as out of tolerance sulfur
limit, water level, pressure or temperature.
The crew‚Äôs intervention may also be required in case operational limits are exceeded
(e.g., if the sulfur content of fuel used exceeds the design limit).
3.8.2
 Demonstration of compliance
For systems under the IMO Guidelines‚Äô Scheme B approval approach, demonstration of
compliance is through the continuous monitoring of emission level SO2 (ppm) to CO2
(% v/v) ratio, and the monitoring of washwater discharge properties.
The SOx Emission Compliance Plan (SECP), Exhaust Gas Cleaning (EGC) Technical
Manual Scheme B (ETM-B) and Onboard Monitoring Manual (OMM) are to be used as
guidance documents for the operation of the system.
Daily spot checks of the operational parameters should be recorded in the EGC Record
Book or Electronic Logging System.
Whenever the scrubber system is operational, the emission level and washwater
properties are to be automatically monitored and recorded by the continuous emission
monitoring system. The recorded data needs to be retained for at least 18 months from
the date of recording and be made available as required.
3.8.3

C
ontingency measures
Regulation 3.1.2 to MARPOL Annex VI provides criteria for exemptions and exceptions
for vessels that experience noncompliance with the emission standards set forth in
regulation 14 of Annex VI to the MARPOL Convention as a result of damage to a ship or
its equipment.
Under that criteria, a shipowner needs to follow regulation 5.6 and notify their flag
Administration for guidance as to necessary measures to be taken. In the case of SOx
scrubber installation, switching to compliant fuel is typically expected until scrubber
repairs are completed. For the exemption to be granted by the flag Administration,
the owner would need to demonstrate that due diligence had been exercised in both
design and operation. In addition, national/regional guidance has also been issued
on the topic. For example, the United Kingdom have issued a Marine Guidance Note,
MGN 510 (M+F), Use of exhaust gas cleaning systems, that addresses potential non-
compliance of scrubber systems.
3.8.4

M
aintenance & repair
To operate properly, the sensors for a scrubber monitoring and recording system need
to be calibrated periodically in accordance with manufacturer‚Äôs guidelines. Since these
sensors can be expected to fail at times, maintaining adequate spares and having a
resupply arrangement in place is important.

American Club: Bunker Compendium30
Commonly identified failures/malfunctions with scrubbers include:
‚Ä¢ clogging of the sampling tubing with soot, which prevents proper SO2/CO2
analyzer readings;
‚Ä¢
 clogging of the pressure transducers at the bottom of the pipe run with debris
due to the inappropriate location of the sensors; and
‚Ä¢ malfunction of the demister in the scrubber chamber due to the build-up
of deposits. Periodic steam cleaning of the system following the maker‚Äôs
recommendations will help to prevent the deposits.
Operational experience indicates that low grade stainless steel, e.g. SS316, will
not withstand the corrosive operational environment within the scrubber chamber.
Fittings of such material installed inside the chamber readily corrode and could require
replacement within 3 years.
Service restriction include wash water discharge restriction, and low wash water
alkalinity in certain trade routes or trade areas. In such scenarios, the system will
need to operate as a closed loop systemwith the following needs to be taken into
consideration:
‚Ä¢
 handling and disposal of sludge;
‚Ä¢
s
torage of bleed-off water; and
‚Ä¢

h
andling and storage of chemical dosing (typically caustic soda).
Other operational issues include possible noise caused bysealing air fans. Appropriate
location of the fans may help to reduce the noise affecting the crew.
3.9 Summary
The forthcoming implementation of the global sulfur cap on January 1, 2020 has brought a
level of uncertainty to the marine industry. It is expected this uncertainty will continue in the
months following the implementation date.
Currently, approximately 2,700 vessels have installed or have contracted to install scrubbers.
By 1 January 1, 2020, the Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems Association predict approximately
4,000 scrubbers. This will address a small portion of the world fleet. Alternative solutions
being considered for the rest of the world fleet to address the sulphur sulfur cap requirement
include the use of compliant fuel. As with the installation of a scrubber, the use of compliant
fuel has commercial implications and requires significant planning to ensure compliance can
be obtained in an efficient and safe manner.

FUEL OIL CHALLENGES: 2020 & BEYOND

4.1
 Introduction
January 1, 2020 will bring on a series of mandatory regulatory changes for the use of marine
bunker fuels relevant to content, testing, management and usage for virtually all ships. In
particular, Annex VI, regulation 18 of the MARPOL 73/78 Convention sets forth requirements
for the quality of marine fuel oils. Regulation 18.3.1.3 explicitly requires that fuel oils cannot
contain any added substances or chemical wastes that may increase the risks to personnel
safety or adversely affect the performance of shipboard machinery.
Added substances and chemical wastes to fuel oils that cause machinery problems are not
new. However, the new requirements for vessels to burn low sulfur fuels of no more than 0.5%
m/m sulfur content have brought to the forefront concerns regarding stability, compatibility
and others such as cold flow properties of these fuels.
Furthermore, experience has shown that the current testing regime as per the requirements
of ISO 8217 do not necessarily identify nor quantify harmful substances from chemical wastes
introduced into bunker fuel.
In light of these challenges, this article discusses and summarizes the current state of affairs
relevant to bunker fuels, forthcoming risks and challenges for shipowners to not only meet
the January 1, 2020 standards, but also ensuring that the composition of marine fuels they
acquire and consume are safe and reliable.
4.2

Wh
at Type of Streams From Which Chemical Contaminants are Seen in Bunker Fuels?
Apparently, several waste streams from a number of petrochemical plants were collected and
offered to some of the suppliers as low cost ‚Äúcutter stock‚Äù. Cutter stock is generally a clean
light petroleum distillate used to reduce the viscosity of high viscosity residual fuel oils in
order to bring the fuel to ‚Äúon specification‚Äú. However due to economic reasons, blenders/
suppliers allegedly do switch to cheaper alternatives of cutter stocks. Unfortunately, cutter
stock tends to be the source of marine fuel contamination. From our experience, several well-
known contaminants seen in waste streams include are but not limited to:
‚Ä¢

eth
ylene crackers ‚Äì styrene, dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) and indene;

phenylethanols, etc.;
‚Ä¢ monomers ‚Äì styrene, DCPD; and
‚Ä¢ coolants ‚Äì ethylene glycols.
4.3
 The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 8217 and Marine Bunker Fuels
The bunker fuel industry has seen many changes in the composition of fuels. Bunker fuels are
formulated from the residual portion of a crude oil distillation process. The residual portion
of the crude oil is normally blended with a lower viscosity product to formulate blends with
different viscosities. The ISO 8217 standards determine various properties of the blends and
the refiner/blender chooses to use different blend stocks to formulate different grades. In the
earlier days, with the use of simple refining procedures, the blends were made from straight
run components from the refinery. For example, atmospheric bottoms mixed with distillates
(middle distillate) to constitute particular grades of bunker fuel.
Currently, several complex refining procedures have been introduced that affect the quality
of the residual products (e.g. vacuum distillation, catcracking, thermal cracking, visbreaking,
etc.). Further, due to the growth in the maritime industry the demand for bunker fuel has
increased steadily.
As the industry expanded with more players coming into the business, cheaper blend stocks
were used. In the earlier days the blend stocks employed were simply distillates from the
refinery and now complex blend components such as residues from ethylene crackers, shale
oil, off-spec biodiesel, light cycle oil and other refinery wastes. Such usage of products
from waste streams has resulted in several contaminants found in bunker fuels. These are
difficult to detect using a conventional ISO 8217 test package resulting in the employment
of Gas chromatography‚Äìmass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis to detect multiple chemical
contaminants in bunker fuels.
Unfortunately, the current ISO 8217 standards do not consider chemical contaminants,
including those as specified in Section 4.2 above. Nor does it specify to conducting GC-MS
analysis on fuels to determine the presence and quantification of contaminants. MARPOL
Annex VI, regulation 18 addresses the presence of chemical contaminants in bunker fuels.
When a fuel is found to have chemical contaminants at certain levels, it is a violation of both
MARPOL Annex VI and ISO 8217 standards.
4.3.1

Ho
w are the new fuels classified under ISO 8217?
In anticipation of the forthcoming January 1, 2020 0.5% sulfur limit, ISO has released
a Publicly Available Specification (PAS), Considerations for fuel suppliers and users
regarding marine fuel quality in view of the implementation of maximum 0.50% sulfur
in 2020. The objective of the PAS is to provide fuel suppliers and user information
on marine fuel quality with the introduction of 0.5% sulfur fuels albeit no new fuel
standards have been introduced. Those standards as set forth in ISO 8217:2017 will
still apply as ISO notes the insufficient time to develop an updated ISO 8217 standard

American Club: Bunker Compendium35
to meet the January 1, 2020 deadline.
The PAS addresses a number of important technical parameters for these fuels
including the kinematic viscosity, cold flow properties of distillate fuels, stability,
ignition characteristics and catalytic fines.
As the new fuels are expected to have very low asphaltenes, the issue of comingling of
fuels and their stability have been addressed in greater detail in the PAS. In particular,
additional test methods and indicators to evaluate stability and compatibility of the
fuels have been included. While the ASTM D4740 spot test is well known, three more
methods (namely ASTM D7060, ASTM D7112 and ASTM D7157) are now accepted. Each
of these tests has an instrument specifically developed to conduct the tests.
In summary, the PAS does not consider any new characteristics for the standard. Tables
1 and 2 of the current ISO 8217 will still be applicable with regards to maximum and
minimum value of various other parameters.
4.3.2
 Is quantification important when chemical contaminants are found in bunker fuels?
Why is it important?
Yes, the quantification of chemical contaminants in bunker fuels is important. It is
necessary to determine at what concentration levels any identified contaminants
are likely to cause problems for shipboard machinery systems. ISO 8217 limits
the presence of any chemical contamination in bunker fuel. There may be some
contamination due to unavoidable circumstances during transfer of fuel in the
refineries, barges, between storage tanks etc. However, this contamination could
be at a very low level. VISWA Lab have been testing bunker fuels for presence of
harmful adulterants for over 15 years. With enough data at its disposal, VISWA Lab has
developed empirical rules to detect levels of single contaminant of combination of
contaminants that are likely to cause problems to machinery.
4.4
 Stability & Compatibility of Fuel Oil Blends
The stability of marine fuel oils is the ability of the fuel to be stable and remain in an
unchanged state when circumstances such as blending, heating may cause it to become
unstable. The stability measures the resistance of an oil to break down and for the
asphaltenes present to precipitate and accumulate to clog fuel oil systems.
Fuel compatibility refers to the suitability of mixing fuels and any possible adverse effects as
a result. As fuel oil blend formulations are expected to vary widely across global geographical
regions. Therefore, ships must, as they do today, consider the risk of incompatibility when
using consecutive fuels from different ports and regions. Compatibility between different fuels
cannot be guaranteed by the suppliers as it is the responsibility of the crew.
5
 Recognizing
that some degree of mixing of different fuel oils onboard the ship cannot be avoided; many
ships today have already procedures in place to minimize commingling of fuel oils with
bunker segregation being always the first option and are encouraged to evaluate further their
segregation policy.
6

To exemplify this concern, note there are five fuel oil samples shown in Figure 4.1, each

of them meeting the standard of a 0.5% maximum sulfur content standard. However, the
difference in coloration, content and clarity are strikingly diverse.
The risks to fuel oil stability and compatibility post January 1, 2020 have not escaped the
industry. as noted above in Section 4.3.1.

arating Fact From Myth Regarding Key Marine Fuel Oil Issues
VISWA Lab has been in the forefront in identifying problem fuels and quantifying the
contaminants and developing empirical formula to determine at what levels what damages
can be expected. Anticipating the introduction of
0.5% sulfur fuels, many labs have begun GC-MS
testing. But without a proper data bank and a track
record in the usage of this instrument, these labs
some providing several misleading information to the
marine industry as listed in Table 4.1.
There is an attempt to confuse people and obfuscate
issues about diagnosing and predicting problems in marine fuels. It is our objective to clarify
the issues, dispel the myths, and establish that the potential problems due to poor quality
fuels can be detected and diagnosed in advance thereby enabling preventive steps to be
taken quickly. The higher purpose of a marine fuel oil testing laboratory is to help the suffering
fuel user from the complications caused by adulterated fuel by accurately identifying the
source and cause of the problem.

Table 4.1 \| Myths versus facts about bunker fuels
MythFacts
Filter blocking is mainly due
to compatibility issues, so it
is the fault of the ship.
Compatibility is one of the many reasons for filter blockage from a fuel
quality point of view. We have observed that the presence of excess
styrene, indene, DCPD (in combination) can cause filter blockage. In
addition, excess FAME content, particularly with high glycerin, can
cause filter blocking.
Polyethylene and polypropylene in the fuel can also cause filter
blocking. Even excess sediment can cause filter blockage. All the
above are problems with the fuel and fuel quality.
Marine fuel oil has a very
large and diverse number of
hydrocarbon configurations
and therefore, give rise to
different and inconsistent
results from different labs.
This is patently untrue. The most common test to detect chemical
contaminants in fuels is by GC-MS testing. Even labs following different
test methodologies to detect chemical contamination in bunker fuels, the
values of the contaminants found with different test methodologies fall
within the same range.
Multiple methods are used
by multiple labs and there
is no standardized method.
American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) brought forth the standard
to carry out GC-MS (ASTM D7845) and the methods and contaminants
identified are all listed. This standard has been in existence for more than 3
years.
GCMS test can be
conducted by several
techniques.
One of the most common and rapid testing techniques used in the
petrochemical industry is by headspace. GC-MS analysis utilizing
the headspace technique will be less accurate and less conclusive,
because it is carried out in a short time. We find this to be true and
that is why we accept only a qualitative assessment of the headspace
results. If a certain contaminant is identified as high, in general, when
we do a full spectrum GC-MS, the high values are confirmed. It is
possible to do headspace to a greater accuracy and a chromatogram
can be supplied. It must be noted that the environmental labs and
pharmaceutical labs use headspace analysis on millions of samples.

American Club: Bunker Compendium38
Table 4.1 (cont.) \| Myths versus facts about bunker fuels
MythFacts
There are nearly 100
million substances in the
CAS library. How can you
identify the contaminants?
Fortunately, the suppliers have over the years tried to adulterate
bunker fuels with a known number of contaminants. By using GC-MS
testing methodology these contaminants have been identified and
documented. Most of the labs use libraries published by National
Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) to validate their findings.
Another common method of confirming these is to calibrate the
GC-MS with known contaminants with known levels. It is possible to
confirm, and, in fact, most of the fuels do not have the contaminants
found in problem fuels. This is a distinguishing factor. Alternately they
may be present at very low levels.
After conducting thousands of GC-MS studies, VISWA have developed
an empirical formula based on which we can not only identify
the contaminants but also at what levels they are likely to cause
problems. Since the fuels referred for investigation are known to have
caused problems, it makes it easy to arrive at an algorithm where
a single chemical adulterant or a combination of multiple chemical
adulterants each with known levels of contaminants will cause the
damage. VISWA has repeatedly stated that when styrene alone is
present even at 2,000 ppm level it will not cause a problem. However,
if styrene, and indene are present and all three are present at
above 100 ppm levels, it can cause problem of polymerization, filter
choking, fuel pump seizure etc.
All bad fuels should be
debunkered.
We know that debunkering is the last option for all parties involved,
since it is the most expensive and the most time consuming choice.
We pride ourselves in trying our best to see if the fuel can be made
usable by either utilizing additives, blending with a better-quality
fuel, or treating the fuel more intensely onboard the vessel.

 Gas Chromatography‚ÄìMass Spectrometry (GC-MS) & Marine Bunker Fuels
Gas chromatography‚Äìmass spectrometry
(GC-MS) is an analytical methodology used to
identify and differentiate chemical substances
within test samples. The methodology is
applicable in many domains such as detecting
drugs, environmental analysis, fire and
explosives investigations and analyzing other
unknown material samples.
The basic principle of this test is the introduction of a vaporized substance into a column
(stationary phase) that is placed in a heated system. The vaporized substance is carried over
to the column by means of an inert gas such as helium or hydrogen. Separation of a mixture
into individual components happens in the column as a function of temperature. Detection of
the separated components is done using several detectors.
‚ÄúChemistry, unlike other sciences, sprang
originally from delusions and superstitions,
and was at its commencement exactly on a
par with magic and astrology.‚Äù
\- Thomas Thompson

American Club: Bunker Compendium39
One of the most common detectors used is a mass spectrometer. Mass spectrometer is one of
the most widely used detector coupled to a gas chromatograph. The separated components
eluting out of the column are ionized in the mass spectrometer. Detection is done basis the
molecular weight of a compound. With the use of libraries, it is possible to easily identify the
compounds separated out from the gas chromatograph.
Hence the name gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
In 1991, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) set up standards for
testing-water, wastewater, and soils and GC-MS became an instrument of choice in the
investigation process. In 1991, the GC-MS equipment occupied the size of a 10x10 foot room.
Furthermore, at that time a single GC-MS analysis cost US$ 3,000. Through the years, the GC-
MS instrumentation accuracy and capabilities continuously improved. Right now, the GC-MS
instrument has come down to the size of a tabletop computer without sacrificing accuracy and
reliability and has become the ‚Äògold standard‚Äô for forensic substance identification.
In 2016, to ensure the consistency and reliability of GC-MS results for marine fuels, the
American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) established the Standard Test Method
for Determination of Chemical Species in Marine Fuel Oil by Multidimensional Gas
Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (ASTM D7845). ASTM D7845 is the internationally
accepted test methodology specially designed to check chemical contaminants in bunker
fuels.
The GC-MS instrument itself needs an operator who is not only a highly trained analytical
chemist but also an intuitive problem solver. Not every analytical chemist can become a top
GC-MS operator and is not a skill that picked up in a matter of months. Apart from the skill of
the analyst, it is also the techniques used in the GC-MS that really produce valuable results.
The industry norm was to carry out ‚Äúheadspace analysis‚Äù which has certain limitations and
produces only qualitative data. Hence this analysis is primarily used as a screening tool. The
same is true for GC-MS vacuum distillation. Alternatively, VISWA applied direct liquid injection
to marine fuel testing, in addition to the methods listed above. VISWA also cross checked
and counter checked where possible with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), a
technique used to determine chemical contaminants known from the infrared spectrum of
different solid, liquid and gas compounds.
GC-MS techniques employed in testing bunker fuels differs in the way a fuel is treated for
introduction into the GC-MS instrument. The most common techniques, along with their pros
and cons are shown in Table 4.2. Each described technique has benefits as well as drawbacks.
However, GC-MS analysis by direct liquid injection is considered the most reliable and
effective technique for detecting a wide range of chemical contaminants that may be found in
marine fuel oils.
4.7

O
bservations & Recommendations
In summary, there are clearly challenges to be tackled and overcome by January 1, 2020. Many
of these challenges cannot be sufficiently addressed until the requirements come into force
when there are more bunker fuel streams that are brought online by the industry to meet the
not to exceed 0.5% m/m sulfur content requirement.
1.

Enough s
amples should be taken when stemming bunkers to not only comply with the
requirements as set forth by regulation 18 of Annex VI of the MARPOL Convention, but

American Club: Bunker Compendium40
also to perform any additional testing as may be necessary that go beyond the tests
of the standard ISO 8217 specifications. Should a consignment of bunker be found to
create problems, the sample can be used to identify any contaminants.
2.
 An updated version of ISO 8217 is scheduled for release before the end of 2019 (ISO
8217:2020). However, the organization has made it clear that there will be no new
characteristics added to those currently listed. But ISO is producing guidance, ISO
PAS 23263, before the end of 2019 to address concerns regarding fuel oil stability and
compatibility.
3.
 Additional testing beyond those specified under ISO 8217 is best performed through
GC-MS techniques by a qualified and reputable laboratory. These techniques do have
their benefits and drawbacks based upon applied methodologies as specified in
Table 4.2. However, they can provide a significant additional insight into any fuel oil
composition that may possibly pose risks to the efficient and effective operation of
auxiliary and main engine systems.
4.
 The need for proper testing of bunkers being loaded and onboard the ship cannot
be overstated. Shipowners should make a concerted effort to ensure that shipboard
crews are properly trained and qualified in procedures for fuel sample collection during
bunkering and onboard testing to comply with port State control testing requirements.

EVALUATION OF CHARTER PARTY CLAUSES & CONTRACTUAL CONSIDERATIONS UNDER ENGLISH LAW
Evangelos Catsambas
Partner
Watson Farley & Williams
5.1
 Introduction
The MARPOL Annex VI provisions that impose the 0.5% sulfur cap on fuel as from January 1,
2020 give rise to a number of issues under English law relevant to existing, ongoing charter
parties and contracts of affreightment.
5.2
 Time Charter Parties
5.2.1 Seaworthiness/fit for service
Time charter parties for bulk carrier vessels, which are invariably on the NYPE form,
contain a requirement for the vessel to be seaworthy on delivery
7
 and fitted for the
service. By way of example, lines 21-22 of the 1946 edition of the NYPE form require
the vessel on delivery to be ‚Äútight, staunch and strong and in every way fitted for the
service‚Äù. Materially similar words appear in lines 32-33 of the 1993 edition of the NYPE
form. Both forms additionally provide for the vessel to be maintained throughout the
charter service (clause 1 of the 1946 edition and clause 6 of the 1993 edition.
This begs the question whether these obligations require the owner to:
1.
 ensure that the vessel is delivered with a scrubber so as to be able to consume
heavy sulfur fuel; and/or
2.
 modify the vessel during the charter to be fitted with a scrubber.
It seems highly doubtful that these obligations require the owner to do so, particularly
since:
1\.
the s
imple alternative is for 0.5% sulfur fuel to be provided;
2.
 the time charterer is under an obligation to provide fuel during the charter as
explained below and can simply provide such fuel;
3\. it may not be a certainty that the particular scrubber installed will actually
perform to specification (compared with the simpler alternative of providing
0.5% sulfur fuel); and
4.

an
y delays arising out of the fitting of a scrubber on board a vessel that is
already on time charter to the charterer may itself lead to a number of issues
and may be something the time charterer commercially does not want.
Where a vessel is provided with a scrubber, additional issues may arise as to:
1.

Whether the o
wner warrants the working condition of the scrubbers (the answer
would appear to be that it does, as with any machinery on board the vessel
under a typical NYPE charter party);
7 Where the charter party includes a clause paramount incorporating the Hague or Hague-Visby Rules into the charter party for
the owner to exercise due diligence to make the vessel seaworthy on delivery, it is thought that the effect is that, apart from
the seaworthiness obligation being converted into one of due diligence on delivery, this also applies before and at the begin-
ning of each voyage under the charter party, by analogy with the Court of Appeal decision in The Saxon Star \[1957\] 1 Lloyd‚Äôs
Rep. 271, where this was held this to be the case for a consecutive voyage charter party.

American Club: Bunker Compendium44
2\. The cost of the scrubbers‚Äô additional energy consumption (where the charter
party does not make such costs for the time charterer‚Äôs account, this would
presumably be for the owner‚Äôs account as it would in the case of the cost of
operating the remaining vessel machinery);
3.
 Whether time counts during maintenance of the scrubber (it would seem that such
time would be for the owner‚Äôs account, as in the case of maintenance of any piece
of vessel machinery); and
4\. Whether the time required to fit a scrubber in drydock is for the owner‚Äôs account
(this will depend on the clause(s) in question).
5.2.2
 Time charterer‚Äôs obligation to supply fuel during the charter
Clause 2 of the 1946 edition of the NYPE form requires the time charterer to ‚Äúprovide
and pay for all the fuel‚Äù. In the 1993 edition this obligation is found in clause 7.
This would presumably require the time charterer to provide 0.5% sulfur fuel that the
vessel is permitted to consume after January 1, 2020 as opposed to high-sulfur fuel
that it is prohibited.
To date, BIMCO has presented the industry with a suite of bunker clauses for
consideration as follows:
1.

BIMC
O‚Äôs 2020 Marine Fuel Content Clause for Time Charter Parties expressly
requires the time charterer to supply low-sulfur fuel:
a.
 For the purpose of this Clause, ‚ÄúSulphur Content Requirements‚Äù means
any sulphur content and related requirements as stipulated in MARPOL
Annex VI (as amended from time to time) and/or by any other applicable
lawful authority.
b.
 The
Charterers shall supply fuels to permit the Vessel, at all times, to
comply with any applicable Sulphur Content Requirements. All such
fuels shall meet the specifications and grades set out in this Charter
Party.
The Charterers also warrant that any bunker suppliers, bunker craft
operators and bunker surveyors used by the Charterers shall comply
with the Sulphur Content Requirements...‚Äù
2.
 BIMCO‚Äôs 2020 Fuel Transition Clause for Time Charter Parties goes hand-in-
hand with its other 2020 clause and requires the same thing in advance of,
and after January 1, 2020. First it requires the time charterer to supply sufficient
0.5% sulfur fuel before January 1, 2020 to enable the vessel to reach the
nearest bunkering port where such fuel is available. Secondly, it requires the
time charterer, at its risk, time and expense and with the owner‚Äôs reasonable
co-operation, to remove the pumpable high-sulfur fuel on board as soon as
possible after January 1, 2020, and no later than March 1, 2020.
Finally, it requires the owner, at its risk, time and cost, to ensure that those
empty bunker tanks are fit to receive 0.5% sulfur fuel (which would therefore
involve them removing any remaining, unpumpable fuel residues at its time, risk
and cost), after which no high-sulfur fuel can be loaded in those tanks. Disputes
could also conceivably arise if the owner is not happy with the time charterer‚Äôs
removal of fuel under the clause. Leaving this to one side, the clause does

American Club: Bunker Compendium45
seem fair and balanced in apportioning risk and expense/time between the two
parties.
3\. BIMCO‚Äôs 2009 Bunker Quality Control Clause for Time Chartering, which more
generally requires the time charterer to ‚Äúsupply bunkers of a quality suitable
for burning in the Vessel‚Äôs engines and auxiliaries and which conform to the
specification(s) mutually agreed under this Charter...‚Äù, likely requires the same
thing.
4.
 BIMCO‚Äôs 2009 Bunker Quality and Liability Clause, however states that the time
charterer ‚Äúshall supply fuels of the agreed specifications and grades‚Äù and that
the fuels ‚Äúshall be of a stable and homogeneous nature and suitable for burning
in the Vessel‚Äôs engines or auxiliaries and, unless otherwise agreed in writing,
shall comply with ISO standard 8217:2010 or any subsequent amendments
thereof.‚Äù does not deal with 0.5% sulfur fuel post-January 1, 2020 because
it concerns compliance with ISO 8217:2017. As noted in Section 4.3.1 of this
compendium, ISO has released the PAS, Considerations for fuel suppliers and
users regarding marine fuel quality in view of the implementation of maximum
0.50% sulfur in 2020, as guidance for shipowners on this matter.
5.

BIMC
O‚Äôs 2005 Bunker Sulphur Content Clause for Time Charter Parties, which
requires the time charterer to supply ‚Äúfuels of such specifications and grades
to permit the Vessel, at all times, to comply with the maximum sulphur content
requirements of any emission control zone when the Vessel is ordered to
trade within that zone‚Äù and to ensure that ‚Äúany bunker suppliers, bunker craft
operators and bunker surveyors used by the Charterers to supply such fuels shall
comply with regulations 14 and 18 of MARPOL Annex VI, including the Guidelines
in respect of sampling and the provision of bunker delivery notes‚Äù does not do
so either because, despite the reference to MARPOL (in particular regulation 14),
it concerns the separate 0.1% sulfur limit applicable in Emission Control Areas
(ECAs) as from January 1, 2015 rather than the 0.5% sulfur limit applicable in
non-ECA as from January 1, 2020.
6.
 INTER
TANKO‚Äôs Bunker Compliance Clause for Time Charter Parties also deals
with 0.5% sulfur fuel. This broad model clause provides owners and charterers
with a complete code to prepare their fixtures, and it can be used immediately
and post-January 1, 2020. Parties have the flexibility to adapt the provisions of
this clause to suit the purposes of their trade. The main elements of the clause
are as follows:
a.
 It requires the time charterer to supply such fuel (as well as 0.1% sulfur
fuel to be consumed in ECA zones) and to ensure that its bunker supplier
provides the BDN and representative samples as required by regulation 18
of Annex VI to the MARPOL Convention, failing which it must indemnify the
owner.
b.
 The owner must in turn ensure, among other things, that the 0.5% sulfur fuel
will be kept separate and not commingled with other fuel.
c.
 The c
lause adds that the vessel‚Äôs speed and consumption warranties will
apply to 0.5% sulfur fuel.
d.

The c
lause additionally states that if the time charterer redelivers the vessel
before the January 1, 2020 date (between a range of dates to be agreed by

American Club: Bunker Compendium46
the parties), then the time charterer will ensure that the vessel will not have
more than a certain amount (to be agreed by the parties) of high-sulfur fuel
and not less than a certain amount (to be agreed by the parties) of 0.5%
sulfur fuel.
e.
 The clause finally states that if the vessel is redelivered on or after December
31, 2019 then the parties will discuss how the tanks must be cleaned by the
time charterer at its risk and expense in order to receive 0.5% sulfur fuel; the
time charterer will bunker sufficient fuel to enable the vessel to reach the
next port at which such fuel can be obtained (failing which the owner can do
so at the time charterer‚Äôs expense); and the time charterer will dispose of
high-sulfur fuel before March 2020 or redelivery (whichever is the earlier).
5.2.3
 Potential fuel contamination disputes
Mention should be made of the possibility that increased demand for 0.5% sulfur
fuel after January 1, 2020 will increase the risk of fuel contamination as blending will
increase significantly in order to meet the anticipated high demand for 0.5% sulfur
fuel.
BIMCO clauses 1 and 2 above ought to cater for this (as well as BIMCO clause 3 so long
as BIMCO clause 1 is also included in the charter party), in addition to the INTERTANKO
clause, making this for the time charterer‚Äôs account (by way of damages for breach of
their provisions).
In addition to this, the BIMCO‚Äôs Bunkering Operations and Sampling Clause should
assist ‚Äì requiring co-operation between the crew and bunker suppliers and requiring
the time charterer to ensure that the bunker supplier complies with the MARPOL Annex
VI sampling requirements and that fuel of different grades are stored separately. The
BIMCO‚Äôs Bunkering Prior to Delivery/Redelivery Clause would only have indirect effect
in this regard combined with the other BIMCO clauses has mentioned, the risk of fuel
contamination should fall on the time charterer.
5.2.4

Owner‚Äôs o
bligation to pay for the bunkers on redelivery
The common requirement under time charter parties for bulk carrier vessels is for:
1.

the time c
harterer to purchase and take over the bunkers on board the vessel on
delivery;
2.

the time c
harterer to provide and pay for the fuel during the charter as noted
previously;
3.

the time c
harterer to redeliver the vessel with about the same bunker quantities
on redelivery; and
4.
 the owner to purchase and take over the bunkers on redelivery.
An example of the obligations referred to in (3) and (4) above can be found in BIMCO‚Äôs
2009 Types and Quantities of Bunkers on Redelivery Clause, which states:
‚ÄúUnless agreed otherwise, the Vessel shall be redelivered with the same
types and about the same quantities of fuels as on delivery; however, the
types and quantities of fuels on redelivery shall always be appropriate and
sufficient to allow the Vessel to reach safely the nearest port at which fuels of

American Club: Bunker Compendium47
the required types are available.‚Äù
Where the vessel is delivered prior to January 1, 2020 with high-sulfur fuel being used
onboard, the time charterer is required to supply 0.5% sulfur fuel after that (during the
charter and on redelivery), but the charter party simply provides for the owners to pay
for the bunkers on redelivery at set prices without making express reference to 0.5%
sulfur fuel, this may lead to a dispute as to the price the owner should pay for this.
5.2.5
 Should it be the charter party‚Äôs high-sulfur fuel price? If not, what price should be
paid, and on what basis?
The answer will depend on the precise charter party provisions. These will tend to be
the tailor-made charter party rider clauses, in circumstances where the BIMCO bunker
clauses make clear that they do not apply to the pricing or quantity(ies) of bunkers (a
conscious decision according to the accompanying BIMCO notes).
Clauses have been encountered in practice that are potentially widely-worded enough
to encompass 0.5% sulfur fuel as fuel which must be paid for at the charter party‚Äôs
high-sulfur price. By the same token, charter party clauses have been encountered that
do not do so.
By way of example, a mere reference to ‚ÄúFO‚Äù (fuel oil) or ‚ÄúLSFO‚Äù (low sulfur fuel oil) or
‚ÄúULSFO‚Äù (ultra-low sulfur fuel oil) would on the face of it encompass low-sulfur fuel;
whereas a reference to ‚ÄúHSFO‚Äù (high sulfur fuel oil) or ‚ÄúIFO 380 CST‚Äù or ‚ÄúIFO 180 CST‚Äù
(high-sulfur fuel) would not. Again, though, the remaining provisions of the clause in
question, as well as any other applicable charter party clauses, must be borne in mind
when construing the apparent meaning acronyms that have been used by the parties.
Moreover, a London arbitration Tribunal or High Court judge ‚Äì where English law
applies, as is invariably the case with time charter parties ‚Äì will be entitled to take into
account any ‚Äúfactual matrix‚Äù background evidence which parties in the owner‚Äôs and
time charterer‚Äôs shoes would have known about at the charter party date.
In the absence of any other applicable charter party clauses where English law governs
the charter party, the time charterer may possibly seek to rely on an argument that it
should be paid the 0.5% sulfur price on the basis that the owner has been unjustly
enriched at its expense. However, such arguments are generally not straightforward
under English law and require the party advancing such an argument to show the
requisite ‚Äúinjustice‚Äù; this would be the case where payment has been made on the
basis of a mistake of fact or law or under duress/undue influence, or where there is a
total failure of consideration. However, none of these examples would apply here.
5.3

V
oyage Charter Parties & Contracts of Affreightment
5.3.1
 Seaworthiness/fit for service
As with time charter parties, it seems unlikely that a seaworthiness obligation under
a voyage charter party and/or a contract of affreightment (i.e. a charter party for a
number of voyages on board vessels to be nominated for cargo shipments between
specified dates) requires the owner to provide a vessel fitted with a scrubber on
delivery.

American Club: Bunker Compendium48
5.3.2 Modification of the freight rate on account of the use of 0.5% sulfur fuel
A number of voyage charter parties and contracts of affreightment include clauses
adjust the freight rate payable by the voyage charterer by a specified amount, or
according to a specified scale, depending on the type of fuel consumed by the vessel
and/or the regions in which such fuel is provided (or where the vessel calls).
For example, BIMCO‚Äôs Bunker Price Adjustment Clause states:
This Contract is concluded on the basis of a bunker price of USD \_\_\_\_\_ per
metric ton for \_\_\_\_\_ oil\* of \_\_\_\_\_ grade. If the bunker price per metric ton
at \_\_\_\_\_\*\* on the first day of loading is higher than USD \_\_\_\_\_ or lower
than USD \_\_\_\_\_, any amount in excess of such increase or decrease shall be
payable to Owners or Charterers as the case may be.
The agreed bunker consumption for each voyage is as follows: \_\_\_\_\_
\\* Indicate whether gas oil, diesel or fuel oil.
\\*\\* Port or place (supplier or published index) to be agreed between the
parties.
BIMCO‚Äôs Bunker Rise Clause for Voyage Chartering sets out a slightly different type
of arrangement by which the voyage charterer directly pays for the bunker price
differential instead of the freight rate being adjusted:
This Charter is concluded on the basis of a price of .......... per ton of\*
............. for bunker\*\* ............. oil of .............. grade in force on the date
of this Charter. If the price actually paid by the Owners during the period of
this Charter for the quantity consumed on the contracted voyage(s) should
be higher, the difference shall be paid by the Charterers to the Owners on
production of the Owner‚Äôs account therefor.
\\* Insert 1,000 kilos or 2,240 lbs as applicable.
\\*\\* Indicate whether diesel, fuel or gas oil.
(NOTE: This Clause is particularly intended for contracts for several voyages).
INTERTANKO have separately issued a slightly more detailed Bunker Adjustment Factor
Clause for Contracts of Affreightment that states:
1.

This
 Contract of Affreightment is concluded on the basis of a bunker reference
price of USD XXX.XX per metric ton (the ‚ÄòBunker Reference Price‚Äô) and will remain
so for the duration of this Contract of Affreightment.
2.

The b
unker price for the purposes of this Contract of Affreightment and
adjustment of freight rates shall be the mid-delivered bunker price per metric ton
published by \[insert supplier or published index and port or place):\
a.\
 Until {insert date} for IFO 380 CST on the date of {firm nomination or bill of\
lading} \[select one} or last published immediately prior to that date\
b.\
 A\
fter {insert date} for low sulphur fuel oil that is compliant with b. MARPOL\
Annex VI 2020 regulatory changes (hereby applied in advance of 1st January\
2020) on the date of {firm nomination or bill of lading} \[select one\] or last\
\
American Club: Bunker Compendium49\
published immediately prior to that date\
(the ‚ÄòBunker Price‚Äô.)\
3\. Any difference between the Bunker Reference Price and Bunker Price shall be\
compensated for in the freight rate using the following bunker adjustment\
factors:\
a.\
 up to USD XX (plus or minus) there shall be no adjustment in the freight rate\
b. for every USD 1.00 per metric ton above or below USD XX the freight rate shall\
be increased or decreased by USD XX cents (USD 0.00) per metric ton\
c.\
 the adjustment in the freight rate, whether a surcharge or a credit, shall\
always be calculated from the Bunker Reference Price.\
INTERTANKO referred to the BIMCO Bunker Adjustment Clause as presented above for\
those of its members seeking to protect themselves from bunker price volatility when\
negotiating a single voyage charter party.\
5.3.3\
 Further considerations regarding freight rate adjustment clauses\
Issues, and therefore disputes, may arise where the freight rate adjustment clause(s)\
in question do not expressly refer to 0.5% sulfur fuel:\
1\. Where a clause simply refers to ‚ÄúFO‚Äù or ‚ÄúIFO‚Äù (intermediate fuel oil) or ‚ÄúLSFO‚Äù or\
‚ÄúULSFO‚Äù, the case for the freight rate to be adjusted would appear stronger;\
2.\
\
Ho\
wever, where the clause refers to ‚ÄúHSFO‚Äù or ‚ÄúIFO 380 CST‚Äù, the case would\
seem much weaker; though\
3\. In either case, the meaning of any acronyms used will depend on their context\
along with the other provisions of the clause(s) in question and/or of any other\
applicable provisions of the charter party/contract of affreightment (COA).\
By contrast, such issues would not be expected to arise where the charter party/COA\
clause expressly refers to 0.5% sulfur fuel, as is now occurring with "bunker adjustment\
clauses" being drafted with the assistance of lawyers with this consideration in mind.\
Finally, whilst BIMCO‚Äôs Bunker Rise Clause for Voyage Chartering quoted above may be\
thought to more obviously apply where 0.5% sulfur fuel is provided, this will actually\
depend on the acronyms inserted in the blanks left by the clause.\
5.4\
 Conclusion\
In summary, it is recommended that parties that are negotiating time charter parties, voyage\
charter parties or contracts of affreightment give serious thought to the BIMCO/INTERTANKO\
clauses that are in circulation dealing with 0.5% sulfur fuel post-January 1, 2020. The clauses,\
as a whole, are comprehensive, addressing the different scenarios that could arise leading up\
to and after January 1, 2020, and they can be adapted for individual needs. Certainty is surely\
better than uncertainty that carry with it significant litigation risks and associated costs.\

DEALING WITH OFF-SPECIFICATION BUNKERS IN THE UNITED STATES: LEGAL & PRACTICAL\
CONSIDERATIONS\

6.1\
 Introduction\
For owners and/or charterers who have taken off-specification bunkers onboard at a United\
States (‚ÄúU.S.‚Äù) port call, there are two considerations that will immediately come to mind:\
1\. what to do with the bunkers that are onboard but have not been consumed, and\
2\.\
wh\
at the options are for recovery of any damages against the bunker supplier or\
manufacturer.\
U.S. law imposes steep hurdles for both considerations.\
6.2\
 The Jones Act Hurdles\
A U.S. law known generally as the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. ¬ß 30104, et seq., prohibits coastwise\
trade (the loading and discharging of cargo between U.S. ports) by a foreign-flagged vessel.\
The initial consideration in connection with an off-specification bunker situation for a vessel\
is what to do once a determination has been made that the bunkers are off-specification.\
When there is confirmation that bunkers loaded at a U.S. port are off-specification, the owner/\
charterer‚Äôs options are limited as follows:\
1.\
\
iIn one s\
cenario, if the vessel is still in the ‚Äúvicinity‚Äù where the bunkers were delivered\
in the first place, it may be possible (subject to an agreement with the bunker\
supplier) to make the necessary arrangements to return the bunkers to the ‚Äúsame\
point‚Äù where the delivery took place. The reference to ‚Äúsame point‚Äù is significant, as\
will be explained below. For instance, if the bunker delivery took place alongside the\
vessel while the vessel is at a dock in Houston carrying out cargo operations, it may\
be possible for the vessel to return to the same dock and for the bunkering barge to\
return to the vessel and offload the off-specification bunkers at the exact point where\
the bunkers were initially delivered to the vessel. This would not constitute a violation\
of the Jones Act. This of course assumes an agreement between the vessel owner/\
charterer and the bunker supplier that the bunkers are in fact off-specification and the\
supplier has agreed to take them back. This approach has proven successful.\
2.\
\
Simi\
larly, if the vessel received the bunkers at an anchorage‚Äîsay for instance the\
Bolivar Anchorage near Galveston, a frequent delivery point for bunkers‚Äîthen it may\
be possible for the vessel to return to the ‚Äúsame point‚Äù (i.e., Bolivar Anchorage) and\
offload the off-specification bunkers to a barge at the same location where the bunkers\
were initially delivered. This again would not be a violation of the Jones Act.\
The point of the above two examples is that the general prohibition of the Jones Act is that a\
\
American Club: Bunker Compendium52\
foreign-flagged vessel may not conduct coastwise trade whereby she loads in one U.S. port\
(one ‚Äúpoint‚Äù) and discharges in another U.S. port (another or different ‚Äúpoint‚Äù). But, if the\
off-specification bunkers are offloaded at the exact same location where they were initially\
delivered, then it is not ‚Äúanother U.S. port‚Äù, and therefore not a violation of the Jones Act.\
3.\
 In the absence of the above circumstances, it would not be possible for a foreign-\
flagged vessel to offload the bunkers at another U.S. port, with one exception. Let‚Äôs\
assume a foreign-flagged vessel is scheduled to receive bunkers at the Port of Houston\
and is then scheduled to sail to the Port of New Orleans. While in Houston the vessel\
receives bunkers and while she is sailing towards New Orleans her crew determine\
the bunkers are off-specification and cannot be used. The vessel, for whatever reason,\
cannot return to Houston (i.e., to the same ‚Äúpoint‚Äù) to offload the off-specification\
bunkers and must continue to New Orleans. The only possible solution in New Orleans\
would be to contract with a U.S.-flagged barge or vessel (i.e. a U.S. Coast Guard\
documented vessel) to take delivery of the off-specification bunkers. If this occurs,\
then the owner/charterer can offload the off-specification bunkers to the U.S.-flagged\
barge or vessel even if that offloading takes place at a different point than where the\
off-specification bunkers were first loaded, because transferring the off-specification\
bunkers at another U.S. port but to a U.S.-flagged vessel is not a violation of the Jones\
Act. In this circumstance it would also be advisable to notify the local director of U.S.\
Customs & Border Protection of the operation. This approach had been taken on a\
number of cases (in respect to a portion of cargo that had to be offloaded), when, even\
though the vessel was still at the same dock where the cargo was received, it was not\
physically or logistically possible to return the cargo to the terminal, so the cargo was\
offloaded into a U.S.-flagged barge. By using a U.S.-flagged vessel to receive the off-\
specification bunkers, there would be no Jones Act violation.\
6.2.1\
 Jones Act waiver\
In the absence of the above two scenarios (i.e., return the bunkers at the same ‚Äúpoint‚Äù\
where they were initially received or offload to a U.S.-flagged vessel), there is next to\
zero probability of being able to offload them at a different U.S. facility, because the\
only way to avoid the Jones Act prohibition on doing so would be to obtain a waiver of\
the Jones Act‚Äôs restrictions. Generally, Jones Act waivers consists of two different types:\
1.\
\
an\
y waiver requested by the Secretary of Defense is granted automatically; or\
2.\
\
an\
y waiver granted by the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security is\
discretionary.\
The general standard for granting a discretionary waiver is that doing so is ‚Äúnecessary\
in the interest of National Defense.‚Äù As one can appreciate, there is virtually no chance\
that offloading off-specification bunkers from a foreign-flagged vessel would ever\
constitute a matter necessary in the interest of national defense sufficient to justify the\
granting of a waiver.\
The above comments are limited to the Jones Act issues a foreign-flagged vessel\
would encounter if she tries to return or offload off-specification bunkers. They do not\
address the potential economic loss for damages. However, and again in the absence\
of an agreement between the vessel owner/charterer and the seller or supplier to\
receive the off-specification bunkers and replace them with acceptable product, the\
owner/charterer can anticipate a substantial loss because any potential purchaser\
\
American Club: Bunker Compendium53\
of the off-specification bunkers would likely purchase them as ‚Äúslops‚Äù, and likely\
offer 20 to 25 per cent of the value of the bunkers. Many vessels‚Äô owner/charterer\
encountered similar troubles over the years when left to deal with a problem on their\
own without any support from the supplier. Of course, any and all such losses in the\
price differential and other related damages would form part of the owner/charterer‚Äôs\
claim against the supplier, subject to the General Terms and Conditions (‚ÄúGTC‚Äù) of the\
supplier. Suppliers‚Äô GTC are often onerous, and many times the vessel owner is not\
even aware of them if the charterer is the contracting party.\
6.3\
 Hurdles to Recovery Against the Supplier or Manufacturer\
In the situation where a charterer has contracted for delivery of bunkers that are later\
determined to be off-specification, and the owner seeks to recover in tort against the supplier\
(with whom it has no contractual privity), there is likely to be an uphill battle. Tort cases\
brought by owners who do not have any contract with the manufacturer or supplier of off-\
specification bunkers are rare and only recently have begun to be attempted in any volume,\
so reference must be made to legal principles established in other contexts in order to predict\
challenges that might be faced.\
In other situations, the owner or charterer may have contractual privity with the supplier, but\
the supplier‚Äôs GTC impose difficult-to-overcome burdens to recovery, such as short time limits\
to bringing any claim, disclaimers of warranties, and limitations of liability. In situations where\
a contract between the parties includes such provisions, the obstacles to recovery become\
even more daunting.\
6.3.1\
 The Economic Loss Rule\
The first hurdle an owner or charterer will face under U.S. law when it pursues a claim\
in tort against the supplier or manufacturer is the U.S Supreme Court‚Äôs ruling in East\
River S.S. Co. v. TransAmerica DeLeval Inc., 476 U.S. 858 (1986). The rule of East River\
and its progeny is that in admiralty cases, a manufacturer or supplier of a product has\
no duty to prevent that product from injuring itself. What this means in practice is that\
pure economic loss arising from the supply of bad bunkers is not actionable in tort;\
absent physical damage to the vessel, an owner can have no tort or strict liability cause\
of action when off-specification bunkers are loaded onboard.\
The plaintiff in East River had contract as well as tort claims against the defendant\
supplier, and the Court reasoned that where only the supplied product was injured,\
the plaintiff‚Äôs claims sounded in contract rather than tort. But the U.S. Court of Appeals\
for the Fifth Circuit has made clear that East River bars recovery of purely economic\
loss even in the absence of contractual privity.\
8\
 Moreover, the more general rule in the\
U.S. that a plaintiff in admiralty must suffer physical damage to its property in order to\
recover any economic loss is alive and strong.\
9\
\
Presumably, however, bad bunkers will almost always result in some type of physical\
damage to the vessel. Damage to engines, or even something as simple as clogged fuel\
filters can be sufficient to satisfy the physical damage requirement.\

6.2.2 General Terms & Conditions (GTC) for Sale of Bunkers\
In modern commerce, no bunker sale is made without first being made subject to the\
supplier‚Äôs GTC. These will vary widely and, in practice, are not well understood by the\
purchaser until after the bunkers have been discovered to be off-specification (and, in\
the case of third-party owners who are not privy to the contract, may not be known at\
all).\
Whether or not those GTC can be made operative on a third party such as a vessel\
owner can depend in large part on the GTC themselves. Some will disclaim all liability\
to third parties and explicitly state that there are no intended third-party beneficiaries\
of the contract. Others will seemingly contemplate potential liability to third parties\
whether in tort or contract, but limit liability to a maximum amount. They may also\
limit any damages to repair or replacement of machinery and disclaim any liability for\
purely economic loss such as downtime and lost profits. If possible, it would therefore\
be prudent to attempt to obtain all contractual documents as well as the supplier‚Äôs\
standard GTC prior to commencing action against the supplier.\
Where the putative plaintiff (whether owner or charterer) was a party to the contract\
with the supplier, the supplier‚Äôs GTC can operate to bar all recovery.\
For instance, the receipt for the delivery of the bunkers will almost universally contain a\
small-print reference making the delivery and acceptance subject to the supplier‚Äôs GTC\
(which will typically be found in even smaller print on the back of the receipt or, more\
usually these days, at a URL address). Once a representative of the purchasing party\
(typically, a member of the crew such as the Mate) signs the delivery receipt, those GTC\
become binding on the parties to the contract.\
Except in regards to towage or employment contracts, U.S. maritime law typically gives\
force to contractual limitations of liability and time bars.\
11\
 Even complete disclaimers\
of liability in tort will be given effect, so long as such a disclaimer is expressly stated.\
12\
\
Courts will examine contractual time bars and deadlines for providing notice, and will\
typically find them to be reasonable and enforceable as long as they do not provide\
for such a short period of time so as to effectively bar any action. That is, so long as\
the time period provided for in the GTC gives the purchasing party an opportunity to\
discover and investigate the alleged breach by the supplier, the limitation period will\
be enforceable and, if not complied with by the purchaser, will effectively bar recovery\
under any theory. For instance, a marine surveyor‚Äôs contractual terms requiring notice\
of a claim within ninety days and the filing of any suit within six months has been\
found to be reasonable and enforceable.\
13\
\
6.3.3 Possible Causes of Action\
Once the ‚ÄúEconomic Loss Rule‚Äù and the supplier‚Äôs GTC have been overcome, a\
charter or third-party owner may have a tort cause of action against the supplier or\
manufacturer of the bunkers. Tort theories of recovery that might be considered are\
fraud, unjust enrichment, product liability, and negligence.\
11 See, e.g., Bisso v. Inland Waterways Corp., 349 U.S. 85 (1955); Syrett v. Reisner McEwin & Assocs., 24 P.3d 1070 (Wash.\
App.‚Äî2001); St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. TGMD, Inc., 2013 A.M.C. 519 (E.D. Wi. 2012).\
12 See Miller Indus. V. Caterpillar Tractor Co., 733 F.2d 813 (11th Cir. 1984).\
13\
 Syrett, 24 P.3d 1070.\
\
American Club: Bunker Compendium55\
6.3.3.1 Fraud\
Fraud will be particularly difficult for a third-party owner to prove, because\
the owner‚Äîby virtue of being a stranger to the contract between the\
charterer and the bunker supplier‚Äîwill in most cases not have been a party\
to the communications between the charterer and the bunker supplier.\
U.S. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) has a higher pleading standard\
for fraud causes of action, and requires a plaintiff to allege: (1) the precise\
misrepresentations made by the defendant; (2) the time, place, and person\
responsible for the misrepresentations; (3) the content and manner in which\
these statements misled the plaintiff; and (4) what the defendant gained\
by the alleged fraud.\
14\
 Without having been involved in the communications\
between the supplier and the charterer, this pleading standard will in most\
cases preclude any claim by a third-party owner for fraud against the bunker\
manufacturer or supplier. But the same pleading standards will apply to an\
owner or charterer who was a party to the contract, and the time bars and\
notice deadlines typically found in a supplier‚Äôs GTC do not typically afford\
plentiful time to discover the facts necessary to adequately plead a claim for\
fraud.\
6.2.3.2\
 Unjust enrichment\
Success on a theory of unjust enrichment seems similarly unlikely to\
succeed. To prevail on an unjust enrichment claim, a plaintiff must show: (1)\
the defendant was enriched; (2) at the plaintiff‚Äôs expense; and (3) equity and\
good conscience require restitution.\
15\
 Notwithstanding the fact that unjust\
enrichment theories are more typically asserted by a supplier who has not\
been paid than by (1) an owner who did not purchase the bunkers but was\
nonetheless damaged by them or (2) a charterer who purchased and actually\
paid for a product that did not meet its specifications, the existence of a\
valid contract governing a particular subject matter ordinarily bars recovery\
on an unjust enrichment theory for events arising out of the same subject\
matter.\
16\
 The existence of a contract between the supplier and the purchaser\
would therefore seem to normally preclude recovery for unjust enrichment.\
6.3.3.3\
\
Pr\
oduct liability\
Generally, a manufacturer has a non-delegable duty to ensure its product\
is reasonably safe for its intended use.\
17\
 The legal theory supporting the\
product liability doctrine is that fault should ‚Äúrest with the party best-\
suited to take preventive steps and reduce the likelihood‚Äù of harm.\
18\
\
Manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers can each be liable when bunkers\
are found to have been ‚Äúunreasonably dangerous‚Äù to the vessel, because\
they are each ‚Äúan integral part of the overall producing and marketing\
enterprise that should bear the cost of injuries resulting from defective\

products.‚Äù\
19\
\
U.S. Admiralty courts look to the Restatement (Third) of Torts\
(‚ÄúRestatement‚Äù) in analyzing maritime claims for product liability.\
20\
 The\
Restatement provides that ‚ÄúOne engaged in the business of selling or\
otherwise distributing products who sells or distributes a defective product\
is subject to liability for harm to persons or property caused by the defect.‚Äù\
21\
\
Under the Restatement analysis, bunkers are defective if they ‚Äúdepart\[\] from\
\[the\] intended design even though all possible care was exercised in the\
preparation and marketing of the product.‚Äù\
22\
\
6.3.3.4 Negligence\
To prevail on a negligence claim, a plaintiff must establish: (1) the defendant\
had a duty to the plaintiff to exercise due care; (2) the defendant breached\
that duty; (3) the plaintiff suffered damages; and (4) the damages were\
proximately caused by the breach.\
23\
\
Where a bunker manufacturer or supplier is essentially a stranger to a\
‚Äúremote‚Äù party such as a vessel owner with whom it had no contractual\
or other relationship, the question of whether a duty existed will turn\
on the foreseeability of the harm.\
24\
 Foreseeability of harm to a vessel‚Äôs\
machinery when off-specification bunkers are burned would not, in the usual\
circumstance, seem difficult to establish. Where the plaintiff is the one who\
actually purchased the off-specification bunkers, foreseeability of harm\
becomes even more clear.\
It can be expected that a manufacturer or supplier would attempt to\
defend itself by showing that in manufacturing or supplying bunkers,\
it followed industry standards. Evidence of compliance with industry\
standards and practices can be admissible as bearing on the standard of\
care in determining negligence.\
25\
 However, compliance with such industry\
standards does not automatically absolve a defendant from liability.\
26\
\
6.4 Conclusion\
Owners and charters who find themselves in possession of off-specification bunkers face a\
number of practical and legal obstacles in order to make themselves whole. The Jones Act\
limitations on options for getting the off-spec bunkers off the vessel are clear. The supplier‚Äôs\
GTC can be expected to impose further burdens on any recovery and, even if those are\
overcome, options for recovery in tort can be limited. Although this is a developing area of the\
law, the general contours of maritime liability discussed above can be expected to govern.\

 Introduction\
From January 1, 2020, the limit for sulfur in fuel oil used on board ships operating outside\
designated emission control areas will be reduced to 0.5% m/m (mass by mass). Shipowners\
are required to comply with the new requirement or otherwise they will be penalized.\
Responses have been sluggish and there might be various disputes between vessel owners\
and time charterers by the time the new requirement comes into effect. As a Member State to\
the IMO and signatory to the MARPOL Convention, China has actively taken steps to ensure\
compliance with the new requirement. This article gives an overview of China‚Äôs current\
practice on sulfur content requirement and discusses the Chinese courts‚Äô approach in dealing\
with potential bunker disputes.\
7.2\
\
An Ov\
erview of China‚Äôs Current Practice\
As a Member State to MARPOL, China has been proactive in complying with the new sulfur\
requirement.\
On 30 November 2018, China‚Äôs Ministry of Transport issued a regulation named The\
Implementation Scheme of the Domestic Emission Control Areas for Atmospheric Pollution\
from Vessels (‚ÄúImplementation Scheme‚Äù) which has been effective from January 1, 2019.\
The Implementation Scheme sets forth several emission control requirements for sulfur oxides\
(SOx) as following:\
1.\
\
Fr\
om January 1, 2019, the ships entering the Emission Control Areas (ECAs) shall use\
marine fuel oil with a sulfur content of no more than 0.5%. Large-scale river ships\
and river-sea ships shall use the fuel oil that meets the newly revised requirements\
specified in the national standards for marine fuel oils, while other river ships should\
use the diesel fuel that meets national standards. From January 1, 2020, ships entering\
the inland river control areas shall use the marine fuel oil with the sulfur content no\
more than 0.1%.\
2.\
\
Fr\
om March 1, 2020, ships entering the ECAs without any alternative measures such\
as sulfur oxides and particulate pollution control devices can only load and use the\
marine fuel oil that should be used in accordance with the ship's Implementation Plan.\
3.\
\
Fr\
om January 1, 2022, ships entering the Hainan Island territorial waters in the coastal\
control areas shall use marine fuel oil with a sulfur content of no more than 0.10%.\
4.\
\
The f\
easibility of using marine fuel oil with a sulfur content of no more than 0.10% is\
\
American Club: Bunker Compendium58\
to be evaluated in a timely manner to determine whether ships entering the coastal\
control areas will be required to that 0.10% fuel from January 2025.\
To comply with the new requirement, Chinese vessel owners are prepared to either use the\
low sulfur fuel (or cleaner fuels like LNG and nuclear energy) or install systems to remove\
sulfur oxides (SOx). Sinopec, a large state-owned oil supplier of China, plans to start the\
supply of low sulfur fuel oil this year in Eastern China ports as they believe the low sulfur fuel\
oil will be a mainstream option in the market.\
Although it is commonplace that English law is the governing law in most charter parties,\
vessels consuming non-compliant fuels in China could still face regulatory and administrative\
liabilities. Currently, China has in place the following bunker fuel requirements:\
1.\
 Pursuant to Article 106 of China‚Äôs Air Pollution Prevention and Control Law (Revised)\
(Atmospheric Law), vessels consuming fuels that are non-compliant with the\
Atmospheric Law could face a fine of not less than RMB10,000 (US$1,400) but not\
more than RMB100,000 (US$14,000) by the maritime administrative agency and the\
competent fishery department. The Atmospheric Law does not express whom to bear\
the fine and only points out that the vessel is to be fined.\
2.\
 The guideline, Supervision and Management for the Ship Emission Control Area,\
published by of the People‚Äôs Republic of China Maritime Safety Administration (MSA)\
in 2016 provides that in addition to fines, enforcement officers can detain vessels for\
inspection or require vessels to correct violations.\
By way of an illustration, in 2017, the MSA as the competent authority imposed a fine of\
RMB60,000 (US$8,500) on a vessel that did not meet the sulfur content requirement.\
Sufficiently grave violations may even lead to a detention by MSA.\
7.3\
\
P\
otential Bunker Disputes in China\
Generally speaking, under a time charter party, it is the charterers who will bear the risk\
of defects in the quality of the bunker. Whereas under a voyage charter party or where the\
vessel is operated by the vessel owner, the risk will be borne by the owner. Although vessel\
owners are primarily liable for fines in case of non-compliance with the new sulfur content\
requirement, it is unclear whether they have a claim against time charterers based on the\
charter party provisions that time charterers shall bear the risk of quality defects in the\
bunker. Such disputes have not arisen yet, but it might be important to look at how Chinese\
courts generally deal with the bunker disputes.\
7.3.1\
\
C\
ase study 1\
Supplier failed to provide compliant bunkers in the case of Fujian Guanhai Shipping\
Limited Company v. Shanghai Huaya Ship Fuel Company (2014) Hu Hai Fa Shang Chu\
Zi No. 114. In this case, parties entered into a bunker supply contract for M/V ‚ÄúGuanhai\
308‚Äù. The defendant bunker supplier supplied about 58 tonnes bunker to the vessel,\
which was mixed with the remaining 20 tonnes of bunker in the tank. Subsequently,\
the vessel‚Äôs bunker system failed and caused corrosion and wear of the vessel‚Äôs parts.\
The plaintiff vessel owner repaired the vessel. Parties jointly submitted the bunker\
sample to testing and test results showed that the acid value of bunker exceeded\
the standard. The owner then unilaterally conducted another test and the test report\
concluded that defective bunker was the main cause of the damage to the vessel.\
\
American Club: Bunker Compendium59\
The court accepted that as the total acid value of the bunker exceeded the standard,\
it might cause corrosion and sedimentation of the vessel‚Äôs parts and thus damage\
the vessel. Also, before the defective bunker was injected, the vessel had not been\
damaged according to the vessel log. The bunker system broke on the thirteenth day\
after the bunker injection. The court also rejected the supplier‚Äôs argument on fuel\
blending as in the case of qualified bunker, even when bunkers are mixed, there\
should be no substantial change that could cause to the vessel‚Äôs bunker system. The\
court thus held that the supplier breached the contract in failing to provide qualified\
bunker.\
7.3.2\
 Case study 2\
The bunker supplier was held not liable in Shanghai Zhonggu Xinliang Co., Ltd. v.\
Shanghai Yucheng Petrochemical Co., Ltd (2015) Hu Hai Fa Shang Chu No. 329. In this\
case, parties entered into a bunker supply contract and stipulated the China‚Äôs national\
quality standard GB/T17411 - 2012 to be the bunker quality standard. In the appendix\
to the supply contract, they also agreed on using the requirement of ISO 8217:2005\
for certain bunkers. Parties agreed that either party can send jointly retained samples\
to the institution approved by both parties for inspection. After the bunker‚Äôs stem, the\
vessel owner also injected light diesel into the four vessels and then the four vessels‚Äô\
bunker systems failed. It transpired that the owner‚Äôs light diesel oil was of poor quality.\
Parties submitted the bunker sample for inspection and the test results showed that\
the bunker sample met the requirement of ISO 8217 ‚Äì 25 (the applicable standard to\
the allegedly defective bunker). The owner then unilaterally sent the bunker sample to\
another institution for inspection and test results showed that the bunker sample did\
not meet the national quality standards. The owner carried out another inspection with\
a different institution and concluded the same.\
The court considered the fact that the owner added light diesel oil to the bunker\
supplied by the supplier and the light diesel oil was proved to be of poor quality. It\
was not conclusive to say that the vessels‚Äô failure was caused by use of the supplier‚Äôs\
bunker.\
Regarding the procedures in testing the bunker quality, the court was of the view that\
national standards are default standards to be applied only when there is no special\
provision in the contract. Since the parties have listed a different bunker quality\
standard in the appendix to the supply contract, the ISO 8217:2005 requirement\
should prevail. Also, it was contractually agreed that both parties shall jointly submit\
the bunker sample for inspection and the court accepted the first test report which was\
jointly conducted. In the absence of clear evidence to show that there were difficulties\
for re-inspection by the jointly appointed institution or the institution‚Äôs impartiality\
was jeopardized, the owner‚Äôs subsequent inspections were not in conformity with the\
contract. The court therefore rejected to adopt the subsequent test results and held the\
supplier not liable.\
7.4\
 Conclusion\
In view of the above-referenced cases, one may expect the Chinese courts to generally follow\
the contractually agreed terms in resolving the disputes unless in the case of ambiguity.\
Potential bunker disputes relating to the new sulfur requirement can be complex as to who\
bears the consequences of non-compliance in the absence of express contractual terms.\

Therefore, parties should be very cautious in drafting the charter party terms and make\
express reference to the allocation of liability in case of non-compliance with the new\
requirement.\

 Introduction\
In this section, we look at two typical examples of off-specification bunker disputes which\
arose and subsequently handled in Singapore:\
8.2\
\
C\
ase Study 1\
Owners chartered the vessel out under an NYPE 93 Time Charterparty. clause 9(b), line 118-\
125, of the charter party provided as follows:\
‚ÄúThe Charterers shall supply bunkers of a quality suitable for burning in the Vessel‚Äôs engines\
and auxiliaries and which conform to the specification(s) as set out in Clause 47.\
The Owners reserve their right to make a claim against the Charterers for any damage to the\
main engines or the auxiliaries caused by the use of unsuitable fuels or fuels not complying\
with the agreed specification(s). Additionally, if bunker fuels supplied do not conform with\
the mutually agreed specification(s) or otherwise prove unsuitable for burning in the Vessel‚Äôs\
engines or auxiliaries, the Owners shall not be held responsible for any reduction in the\
Vessel‚Äôs speed performance and/or increased bunker consumption, not for any time lost and\
any other consequences.‚Äù\
8.2.1\
 Sequence of events\
Around 600MT of MFO380 bunkers were supplied to the vessel. The owners tested\
the bunkers supplied by the charterers and obtained a report on concluding that the\
bunkers contained non-hydrocarbons, in breach of the requirements in paragraph 5 of\
ISO 8217:2005 and thereby also in breach of clause 9(b) of the NYPE93 standard form\
read with the abovementioned rider clause.\
The owners requested the charterers to de-bunker at their time and costs, but the\
charterers refused. At the time, the vessel had already consumed a portion of the\
bunkers without issue. The charterers then agreed to a joint testing with the owners\
which showed that the bunkers were indeed off-specification.\
8.2.2\
 No contractual provisions to resolve bunker quality dispute\
More often than not, charter parties fail to provide for how sampling or testing\
of bunkers should be carried out in the event of a bunker quality dispute. It is\
recommended that the following should be considered or provided for:\
\
American Club: Bunker Compendium62\
‚Ä¢ joint testing in the event that the owners allege that the bunkers are off-\
specification\
27\
;\
‚Ä¢ the party who will bear the costs of testing the bunkers; and\
‚Ä¢\
the t\
ests which are to be conducted.\
Owners are recommended to include in the charter party an express right that they\
may, at their sole discretion, de-bunker the off-specification bunkers and for all costs\
of the de-bunkering to be borne by the charterers. However, this will not be exhaustive\
of the owner‚Äôs mitigation options.\
On the other hand, charterers are recommended to include in the charter party the end\
supplier‚Äôs terms and conditions relating to the quality, quantity, risk, sampling, mode\
and time of delivery of the bunkers supplied on a back-to-back basis.\
8.2.3\
 Should the owners take the commercial risk to burn off-specification bunkers?\
While commercial considerations and the common law doctrine to mitigate losses\
may compel owners to take the risk to consume off-specification bunkers, it is not\
recommended to do so prior to joint testing. This is as such an action may be seen as\
an assumption of responsibility over the bunkers/burning and it may be difficult to\
seek recourse later against the charterer or supplier.\
If bunkers are to be burned, it is recommended for owners to get a letter of indemnity\
from the charterers and clearly identify and agree who is to bear the costs of\
such burning, the consequences of such burning and for any replacement fuel.\
Consideration must be given to whether the charterer is substantive enough to pay up\
under such a letter of indemnity.\
It is important to note that an aggrieved party is not required to act in a way which\
exposes it to financial or moral hazard (e.g. taking steps which might jeopardize its\
commercial reputation or partaking in hazardous litigation against a third party), or to\
incur great expense or put itself to great inconvenience in stemming the loss.\
8.3\
 Case Study 2\
Along the same contractual chain, issues between suppliers and charterers often translate to\
dispute between charterers and owners (and vice versa) as parties attempts to pass around\
potential losses. When multiple parties conduct their own testing and get different results,\
how should the matter be resolved?\
In this case, the sellers purchased bunkers from the physical suppliers on their general terms\
and conditions, for supply to the charterers. The terms entered into between the sellers and\
the charterers mirrored those entered into between the seller and the physical suppliers of the\
bunkers.\
Physical suppliers‚Äô GTC, in pertinent part, was provided as follows:\
Clause 5:\
a.\
\
The\
specifications of the Marine Fuels supplied to Buyer shall be the Seller‚Äôs or\
Seller‚Äôs suppliers‚Äô commercial grades as per normal Singapore bunker ISO 8217\
27 See the American Club‚Äôs animations for bunker testing best practices at https://www.american-club.com/page/bunker-fuels.\
\
American Club: Bunker Compendium63\
specifications offered generally to their customers at the time and place of delivery\
b. Seller shall not be liable to delivery Marine Fuels with any characteristics or\
specification\
c.\
 Sampling by Seller or Seller‚Äôs supplier shall be done throughout the Marine Fuels‚Äô\
delivery i.e. continuous drip sampling as per MPA SS600. The barge drip samples\
which will be final & binding shall be retained by Seller or Seller‚Äôs supplier for thirty\
(30) days from the date of delivery in a safe place for verification of the quality thereof,\
if required.\
d.\
 If Buyer makes a claim or complaint within the period of the date of delivery in\
accordance with Section 13(b) below, based on the analysis of the barge retained\
samples, shall be submitted for analysis to a mutually independent laboratory. The\
mutually independent laboratory‚Äôs analysis shall be conclusive as to the quality of the\
product delivered. The analysis shall be established by tests in accordance with ISO\
8217 and/or any other specifications agreed to between Buyer and Seller. If the tested\
result favors Buyer, the Seller shall bear full cost of testing, however if the result favors\
the Seller, then the Buyer shall bear full cost of testing.\
Clause 13:\
a.\
\
An\
y claim as to the quality of the fuel delivered must be submitted by Buyer to Seller\
in writing within twenty-one (21) days of the date of delivery. If Buyer fails to submit a\
quality claim within twenty one (21) days of the date of delivery, any such claim shall\
be deemed to be waived and absolutely barred. Buyer shall base its quality claim\
solely on an analysis of the retained drip sample provided by Seller at the time of the\
delivery as provided for in Section 5(a) above. Buyer shall furnish Seller the results of\
testing of the retained sample to enable Seller to properly evaluate the claim.\
b.\
 The ana\
lysis shall be established by tests in accordance with ISO8217 (latest edition at\
the time of delivery) and/or any other specifications agreed between Buyer and Seller.\
For interpretation of test results the method as set out in ISO 4259 sections 9 and 10\
in respect of precision and interpretation of test result shall be used. The results of\
the analysis shall be conclusive as to the quality of Marine Fuels delivered except in\
cases of manifest error. Unless otherwise agreed, the expenses of the analysis by the\
independent laboratory shall be borne by the party whose claim is unsupported by\
the test results.\
8.3.1\
\
Sequenc\
e of events\
The charterers ordered from the suppliers 1,000 metric tons of high sulfur fuel oil\
(HSFO) 380 centistokes (cst) residual marine gas oil (RMG) with a maximum of sulfur\
content of 3.5% m/m, with specifications set forth under ISO 8217:2005. The sellers\
ordered the same from the physical suppliers.\
The bunkers were supplied to the vessel. Meantime, the sellers conducted a survey\
and testing on the stemmed bunkers. The results of the testing were set forth in a\
report showing that the bunkers were on-specification.\
About a week later, the charterers obtained a report which stated that the bunkers\
were off-specification as it did not meet the density and viscosity requirements of ISO\
\
American Club: Bunker Compendium64\
8217:2005, contained excessive water, and high levels of sodium and catalytic fines.\
The charterers thereafter refused to consume the bunkers, claiming that the vessel‚Äôs\
safety would be compromised.\
About a week later, a joint testing attended by representatives of the owners,\
charterers, sellers and physical suppliers was conducted. The results revealed that\
the bunkers were on-specification. Thereafter, owners and charterers conducted their\
own testing on two different samples. The results of both tests indicated that the\
bunkers were off-specification. In particular, the density, kinematic viscosity, water by\
distillation and calcium levels of the bunkers exceeded the maximum specification.\
The physical suppliers maintained that the bunkers should be burned as part of the\
duty of mitigation. This was relayed by the sellers to the charterers. On the other hand,\
the charterers refused to do so unless a letter of indemnity was provided.\
The physical suppliers took the position that the joint testing results which indicated\
that the bunkers were on-specification were final and binding. However, the sellers\
took the position that an average of the joint testing results and charterers‚Äô test results\
should be taken, and that would indicate that the bunkers were off-specification.\
In the meantime, the charterers and/or the owners de-bunkered the vessel and only\
recovered a portion of the costs of the bunkers.\
8.3.2\
\
P\
oorly drafted contractual provisions led to delay in resolving the bunker quality\
dispute\
In this case, the poorly drafted physical supplier‚Äôs GTC led to confusion and delay in\
resolving the bunker quality dispute between sellers and physical supplier.\
Sellers argued that clause 13(c) of the physical supplier‚Äôs GTC would also refer to the\
charterers‚Äô test and that a comparison of that test with the joint test, pursuant to ISO\
3104 and ISO 12185, was required to determine whether the fuel was on-specification\
or not. This brought into question whether the fuel quality be determined based on an\
average taken from the tests, or was the sample retained used in the joint test the final\
and binding result.\
To prevent this impasse, physical suppliers should have clearly provided in their\
contract that sections 9 and 10 of ISO 4259 were to only apply to the joint test and only\
the joint test is final and binding on all parties.\
It is recommended that across chains of contracts, provisions for joint testing in the\
event that the owners or charterers allege that the bunkers are off-specification should\
be put in place, with such joint testing results as being final and binding on all parties.\
The test to be used in such joint testing should also be clearly specified.\
8.4\
 Conclusion\
In conclusion, the overwhelming number of bunker claims and disputes involving owners,\
charterers and physical suppliers have given all three parties a clear indication of what could\
go wrong when bunkers are in issue. Owners and charterers should act on the above lessons\
learnt from the pandemic off-specification bunkers issues to tackle potential problems that\
could arise out as of January 1, 2020.\
