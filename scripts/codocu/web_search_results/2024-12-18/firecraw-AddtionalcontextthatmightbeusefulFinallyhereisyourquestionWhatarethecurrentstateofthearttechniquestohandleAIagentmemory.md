[BFA Product Design](http://www.newschool.edu/parsons/bfa-product-design) alumna Yogita Agrawal ’15 blends entrepreneurship, sustainability, and community-oriented design in the work of Ware Innovations, her Mumbai-based startup. While at Parsons, Agrawal devised Jhoule, a wearable, human-motion-powered lamp for use in off-grid Indian villages. And she and two other Product Design students  created Soapen — a crayon-like soap that encourages children to wash their hands — which won an award and support from UNICEF. Agrawal's interdisciplinary design studio is currently developing a range of sustainable household products.

As Director of Design Strategy and Operations of The Lab at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, Sean Baker helps government organizations use design to address pressing public issues. He works with nonprofits, NGOs, and agencies to improve the policies, programs, services, and products that civil servants and citizens rely on daily. Baker’s government position is raising awareness of the importance of well-reasoned service design and has made the MFA Transdisciplinary Design graduate a sought-after advisor on design-led change.

📖 **Summarizing content**...

The provided text is about news and events related to Parsons School of Design and The New School. It does not contain information about AI agent memory techniques. 

To get information about state-of-the-art techniques for handling AI agent memory, you should look for resources specifically focused on artificial intelligence and machine learning. Some good starting points could be:


* **Research papers:** Websites like arXiv (https://arxiv.org/) and Google Scholar (https://scholar.google.com/) host a vast collection of academic papers on AI, including those focusing on memory mechanisms.
* **Online courses and tutorials:** Platforms like Coursera, edX, and Udacity offer courses on deep learning and reinforcement learning, which often cover topics related to agent memory.
* **AI community forums:** Websites like Reddit's r/MachineLearning subreddit or specialized AI forums can be valuable for asking questions and getting insights from experts in the field.

Remember to specify your search queries with keywords like "AI agent memory," "memory architectures," "long-term memory in AI," or "attention mechanisms" to get more relevant results.
