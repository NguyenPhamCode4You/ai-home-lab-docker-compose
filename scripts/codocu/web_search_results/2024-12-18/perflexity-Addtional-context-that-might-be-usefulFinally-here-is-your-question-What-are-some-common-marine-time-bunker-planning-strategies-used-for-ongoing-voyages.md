To answer the question about common marine time bunker planning strategies used for ongoing voyages, here are some key strategies and considerations:

1. **End-to-End Approach**:
   - **Operational Planning**: This involves integrating operational planning with real-time bunker data to make informed decisions. It considers factors like the impact of operational planning and performance-based changes on the total cost of bunkering, not just the cost of bunkers in isolation[1].

2. **Voyage Planning Phase**:
   - **Identifying Bunkering Locations**: The most suitable bunkering locations are identified based on various factors such as cost, availability, market trends, bunker supplier history, and other operational considerations[1].

3. **Real-Time Data Integration**:
   - **Combining Performance and Market Data**: Data on the vesselâ€™s performance and the voyage is combined with real-time data on bunker prices, availability, and market trends. This integration enables the identification of potential issues and the ability to make informed decisions about whether to continue along the intended route or deviate[1].

4. **Optimizing Liftings**:
   - **Bunker Prices at Fueling Ports**: For type OV voyages, liftings can be optimized based on bunker prices at fueling ports specified in the Voyage Estimate Itinerary. This involves calculating the most advantageous fueling port by subtracting the freight rate of one cargo from the bunker price at the next port[3].

5. **Bunker Quantity Discrepancies**:
   - **Maintaining and Sharing Data**: To reduce the risk of disputes due to bunker quantity discrepancies, maintaining and sharing data on unscrupulous suppliers across networks is crucial. This enhances transparency and efficiency in bunker procurement workflows[1].

6. **Preparation and Checklist**:
   - **Before Bunkering Checklist**: A comprehensive checklist is essential before bunkering. This includes tasks such as calculating ROB (Residual Oil on Board), ordering bunkers, preparing paperwork, and ensuring all safety procedures are in place. The checklist also covers the sequence order of tanks to be filled, how much bunker oil is to be taken, and emergency procedures in case of an oil spill[2][4].

7. **During Bunkering**:
   - **Filling Sequence and Safety Measures**: During bunkering, the sequence of transferring oil into the tanks should be according to the plan. It is crucial to fill all tanks simultaneously to avoid fuel overflow and to check relief valves and overflow tank soundings regularly[2][4].

8. **After Bunkering**:
   - **Post-Bunkering Procedures**: After bunkering, it is essential to disconnect the bunkering supply line, complete paperwork, sample the received bunkers, and calculate the received bunker quantity. The ship's draft or trim should also be checked to ensure the correct amount and quality of bunker fuel has been received onboard[2][4].

9. **Market Surveillance and Proactive Planning**:
   - **Bunker Department Roles**: The bunker department plays a crucial role in market surveillance, proactive bunker planning, preparing bunker schedules, and maintaining a constant dialogue with vessels, brokers, and voyage operators. This ensures minimal disruptions and maximum efficiency in the bunkering process[5].

By integrating these strategies, marine time bunker planning can be optimized for ongoing voyages, ensuring cost savings, operational efficiencies, and minimizing risks associated with bunkering operations.
