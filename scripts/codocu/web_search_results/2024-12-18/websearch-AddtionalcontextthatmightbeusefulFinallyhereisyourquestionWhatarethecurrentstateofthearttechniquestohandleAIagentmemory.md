While the provided text discusses various aspects of AI, including Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and its limitations, it doesn't delve into specific techniques for handling AI agent memory.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed answer to your question based on the given content.

However, I can offer some general information about state-of-the-art techniques in AI agent memory:

* **External Memory:**

    * This involves storing memories outside the agent's immediate computational core. 
    * Examples include databases, knowledge graphs, or specialized memory modules.
    * Allows for storing vast amounts of information and enables retrieval based on complex queries.

* **Attention Mechanisms:**

    * These mechanisms allow agents to focus on relevant parts of their memory when making decisions.
    * They weigh the importance of different memories based on their context and relevance to the current task.
    * Popular in transformer-based architectures used in language models.

* **Memory Networks:**

    * Designed specifically for handling sequential data and learning long-term dependencies.
    * Employ an external memory component that is updated and accessed through a series of read and write operations.
    * Effective for tasks like question answering, text summarization, and dialogue systems.
* **Neuro-Symbolic AI:**  

   * Combines the strengths of neural networks (learning patterns) with symbolic reasoning (logical rules).
   * Allows for more explicit representation and manipulation of knowledge, potentially leading to more robust memory systems.

Keep in mind that this is just a brief overview, and the field of AI memory is constantly evolving with new techniques emerging.
