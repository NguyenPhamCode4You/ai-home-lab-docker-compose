[![Optimising Bunkering Processes in Maritime Operations](https://thetius.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/seagulls-8163894_1280-1140x570.jpg)](https://thetius.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/seagulls-8163894_1280.jpg)

Procuring bunkers and managing a vessel‚Äôs refuelling is one of the most complex processes in pre-voyage planning and voyage execution. As the shipping industry increasingly turns to new and more expensive fuels, optimising this process is necessary to improve a voyage‚Äôs profitability.

The end-to-end approach considers the impact of operational planning and performance-based changes on the total cost of bunkering rather than just the cost of bunkers in isolation. Aman Talwar, Head of Bunkers at GeoServe, succinctly captures this: ‚ÄúIn the face of evolving bunker landscape, our priority has shifted towards optimising not just the cost but the very essence of our customers‚Äô bunker planning strategy. It‚Äôs about comprehensively addressing ‚ÄòWHERE to buy WHAT, and HOW much to buy?‚Äô‚Äù The voyage planning phase involves identifying the most suitable bunkering locations based on various factors. However, as the voyage progresses, data on the vessel‚Äôs performance and the voyage is combined with real-time data on the cost and availability of bunker grades, market trends, bunker supplier history, and other factors, enabling the identification of potential issues and the ability to make informed decisions.

The data may show that the cost of bunkers is competitive, availability is high, and there is little to no congestion, enabling the vessel to reach its berth at the agreed time without any route deviation. In another scenario, the data could show that bunker prices have risen, and it may make sense to secure bunkers at another destination. By integrating all of this information, a decision can be made on whether to continue along the intended route or deviate. If the vessel is under voyage charter, it must ensure that a change in route is permitted under the charter party terms.

We spoke with one tanker operator who shared how access to data that highlights inefficiencies in bunkering and suggests alternative options for the voyage is a game-changer. ‚ÄúWe have done the majority of our bunkering in major bunkering hubs, but we have also taken bunkers in ports not commonly used for bunkering. The price difference between the major hubs and other ports can be quite high. Sometimes you can‚Äôt avoid it and you have to bunker where you can, but there are other instances where you can avoid bunkering at that specific location. Having access to information that tells us first of all if it‚Äôs feasible to avoid bunkering at that port and how much money or time we would save by going elsewhere is really valuable for us. It means we can look at our procedures and processes and improve upon that, leading to significant cost savings and operational efficiencies.‚Äù

According to [Fuel Trust](https://shipandbunker.com/news/world/455199-quantity-discrepancies-seen-in-39-of-bunker-deliveries-fueltrust), 39% of the deliveries from 2019 to 2022 had bunker quantity discrepancies. Although [Mass flow metres](https://www.nepia.com/industry-news/bunker-quantity-disputes-mass-flow-meters/) (MFM) was a welcome development, the industry still suffers from unscrupulous suppliers. Bunker quality issues are another common issue faced by ship operators. Maintaining and sharing data on unscrupulous suppliers across networks and integrating this into bunker procurement workflows can significantly enhance transparency and efficiency, reducing the risk of disputes.

Overall, efficient bunkering management is vital for maritime profitability. An end-to-end approach integrating operational planning with real-time bunker data enables informed decisions, optimising processes, enhancing transparency, and minimising risks. Solutions like [GeoServe‚Äôs](https://geoserves.com/) [GeoStem](https://geostems.com/) streamline operations, driving cost savings and efficiencies for ship operators.

üìñ **Summarizing content**...

While I cannot directly access external websites or specific files online, including the URL you provided, I can give you general information about common marine time bunker planning strategies used for ongoing voyages based on my existing knowledge. 


Here are some key considerations:

- **Route Optimization:**  
    - Careful planning of the ship's route is crucial. Shorter routes and favorable currents can minimize fuel consumption.

- **Weather Routing:**
    - Analyzing weather patterns to avoid storms and rough seas that increase fuel usage is essential.
- **Speed Optimization:**
    - Ships often operate at speeds that balance transit time with fuel efficiency.  Slightly reducing speed can significantly reduce fuel consumption over long distances.

- **Bunker Availability and Pricing:** 
   - Planning refueling stops strategically to take advantage of ports with lower bunker prices is a significant cost-saving measure.

- **Just-In-Time Bunkering:**
    - Ordering and receiving bunkers only when needed helps minimize storage costs and the risk of price fluctuations.

- **Bunker Quality Monitoring:** 
    - Ensuring the quality of bunkers is vital to engine performance and fuel efficiency. Regular testing and supplier selection are important.

- **Fuel Consumption Tracking and Analysis:**
   - Using onboard systems or shore-based software to monitor fuel consumption rates in real time allows for adjustments to operational practices to maximize efficiency.

- **Alternative Fuels:** 
    - Exploring the use of alternative fuels, such as LNG (liquefied natural gas) or biofuels, can reduce emissions and potentially lower fuel costs in the long run.

Let me know if you have any other questions about maritime operations!
