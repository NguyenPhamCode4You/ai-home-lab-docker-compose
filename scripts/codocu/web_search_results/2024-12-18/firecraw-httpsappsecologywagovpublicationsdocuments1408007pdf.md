INTRODUCTION
The Washington State Department of Ecology regulates oil
transfers over Washington waters to help prevent oil spills.
The bunkering best practices checklists in this guide comply
with the Washington State bunkering rule (Chapter 317-40
WAC). Find the full rule at http://apps.leg.wa.gov/wac.
The checklists include the experience and knowledge
of our spill prevention inspectors. Our inspectors have
conducted and observed thousands of bunkering operations
and reviewed many more vessel oil transfer/bunkering
procedures.
The practices highlighted in this manual are meant to create
a spill prevention mindset during your bunkering operations.
They do not replace your vessel‚Äôs procedures or the federal oil
transfer requirements of the U.S. Coast Guard.
In addition to state regulations, vessel owners and operators
must also comply with the following U.S. Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR) requirements:
‚Ä¢ Title 33, Parts 155 & 156.
‚Ä¢ Title 46, Sections 12, 15, & 35.
Failure to comply with federal requirements is a failure to
comply with the Washington State bunkering rules. Find
CFR information at www.ecfr.gov.
The primary causes of spills are fatigue,
inattention, poor communication, and
unclear procedures and policies.

BOOMING OIL TRANSFERS
In Washington State
Pre-booming requirements
We have determined that high-rate over-water oil transfers
present the highest risk of a sizeable oil spill.
All bunker barges delivering oil must deploy containment
boom equipment before starting over-water oil transfers at
rates greater than 500 gallons per minute, when it is safe and
effective to do so.
The pre-booming requirements will be met by the bunker
supplier. If at anchor, vessel operators may be asked to
tie lines to the ship to secure the boom during bunkering
operations.

both the ship and the bunkering vessels.

Pre-booming is the first line of defense
While our first priority is preventing spills from occurring,
pre-booming oil transfers is our state‚Äôs first line of defense if a
spill happens.
Pre-booming helps reduce damage to our natural resources.
This is especially important in a high risk area like Puget
Sound where many oil transfers occur.
Pre-booming can:
‚Ä¢ Prevent or reduce
environmental damage.
‚Ä¢ Speed cleanup efforts
and reduce cleanup
costs.
‚Ä¢ Reduce economic
impacts on the
community where a
spill occurs.
‚Ä¢ Reduce resource
damage assessment
fines.

BUNKER PROCEDURE CHECKLIST:
Written Pre-loading Plan
The receiving vessel‚Äôs person in charge (PIC) must prepare
a pre-loading plan prior to conducting the training session
(required within 48 hours of the operation) and transfer
of bunkers. The PIC must ensure that a copy of the plan
is posted in a place where it can be easily seen by, and in a
language common to, the vessel crew engaged in bunkering.
The pre-loading plan must include:
‚òê Identification of location and maximum fill level of tanks
receiving oil.
‚òê Level and type of liquid in each tank before bunkering.
‚òê Planned final level of tanks and the planned final percent
of each tank to be filled.
The final planned tank fill level in the plan should be
recorded in the same way that tank levels are taken.
For example, don‚Äôt take soundings of tank depth and
record a planned final as an ullage. The person taking
soundings should know the planned fill point as the
tank is filled.
‚òê Order in which tanks will be filled.
This ensures all bunkering team members know which
valve(s) will be opened and which tanks sounded next.
‚òê Procedures to regularly monitor all bunker tank levels and
valve settings.

Additional information
‚úì Pre-loading plan: Your vessel might have a pre-loading
or pre-bunker plan form that differs from the sample plan
provided on page 37. As long as your plan contains the
required information, and the bunker team is trained and
familiar with your plan, you can organize your plan as you
see fit.
‚úì Hydrostatic testing: In preparation for bunkering, ensure
that your system has been hydrostatically tested within the
past year, per 33 CFR 156.170.
‚úì Spill response gear: Ensure that your shipboard oil
pollution emergency plan (SOPEP) response gear is
complete and readily available.

Personnel assigned to bunkering operations cannot work
more than 15 hours in any 24-hour period, nor 36 hours in
any 72-hour period (including the time it takes to bunker).
Relief should be provided to those that will exceed these
restrictions.
‚òê Assign a person to stand watch at the bunker header, and
record the name of this point-of-transfer watchstander in
the oil transfer procedure (OTP).
 The point-of-transfer team member and the deck rover
must have radio communication with both the PIC,
usually the chief engineer, and the master or deck watch
officer. This ensures the ability to quickly raise the alarm
if a spill or problem occurs.
‚òê Assign a person as a deck rover watch, and record their
name in the OTP.
The main duty of the deck-rover is to watch for oil spills
on deck and over the side during bunkering. The deck-
rover may perform other duties not in conflict with his
or her primary duty. The deck-rover must:
(i) Visually inspect the deck and water near or
opposite all bunker tanks and each tank‚Äôs
sounding tube and vent, if accessible; and
(ii) During changing over of tanks or topping off,
remain in a position to view any spills on deck or
in the water.
‚òê Ensure each watchstander has two-way communication
with the PIC and master or officer in charge.
‚òê The PIC must ensure they receive regular sounding reports
as stated in the pre-loading plan.
‚òê Write the pre-loading plan in a language common to all
bunkering crew and post it where it can be easily seen by
bunkering personnel.

Additional information
‚úì Fatigue: In Washington State, fatigue is a contributing
factor in many bunker spills. Maneuvering, short port
stays, regulatory inspections, taking stores, required
maintenance, and bunkering can make it difficult to
get adequate rest. Bunkering is a critical operation, and
proper rest for bunker team members is essential and
required. If they do not meet the rest-hour minimums,
the bunkering must be delayed until the bunker team
members are sufficiently rested according to rest-hour
requirements. For more information about fatigue, refer to
page 28.
‚úì Sounding reports: The receiving vessel‚Äôs PIC must ensure
that he or she receives sounding reports on tank levels
according to the monitoring procedure set in the vessel‚Äôs
pre-loading plan. Soundings should be more frequent
during start-up and topping-off.
‚úì Oil Transfer Procedures (OTP): 33 CFR 155.750 requires
vessels to have an OTP, including specific standards.
Inspectors often find the OTP posted differs from the
bunkering procedure actually used by the vessel. All OTPs
posted throughout the vessel should reflect the same duty
assignments, transfer requirements, and transfer data.
‚úì Records retention: After bunkering, the written pre-
loading plan and declaration of inspection (DOI) must be
saved for at least 30 days.
11
A point-of-transfer watch must
remain at the point of connection
with the delivering vessel during
bunkering.

BUNKER PROCEDURE CHECKLIST:
Training for Bunker Crew
The vessel‚Äôs PIC must conduct a training session for all
personnel with duties under the vessel‚Äôs OTPs within 48 hours
prior to a vessel‚Äôs scheduled bunkering.
Training must include, but is not limited to, review of:
‚òê Pre-loading plan.
‚òê Civil and criminal penalties and liabilities for not
complying with federal and state regulations, and for
spilling oil in Washington waters. For more information
about penalties go to page 34.
‚òê OTPs, including each person‚Äôs bunkering duties.
During training
‚òê Instruct all bunkering personnel, except the deck-rover, that
only bunkering duties may be performed during bunkering.
‚òê Ensure the primary duty of the deck-rover is to monitor for
oil spills on deck, or over the side, during bunkering. The
deck-rover may perform other duties not in conflict with
his or her primary duty.
‚òê Make clear that all personnel are to remain at their assigned
locations during topping-off.
‚òê Make sure communications between receiving and
delivering vessels are understood, including English phrases
and hand signals for ‚ÄòStop,‚Äô ‚ÄòHold,‚Äô ‚ÄòWait,‚Äô ‚ÄòFast,‚Äô ‚ÄòSlow,‚Äô and
‚ÄòFinish.‚Äô For more information, go to the Communications
Guide on page 36.
‚òê Review emergency shutdown procedures.
12

Immediately after training
‚òê The master, or their designee, should enter the date and
time of training in an official log or deck log. List only the
names and ratings of attendees.
Additional information
‚úì If crew who are not normally assigned bunkering duties in
the OTP end up being assigned such duties, the PIC must
train such personnel before they can assume bunkering
responsibilities. Conduct training in a language common
to both the PIC and crew being trained.
‚úì Many times, the bunkering gets delayed or the quantity
changed. If the bunkering is delayed beyond 48 hours,
conduct a refresher training session to ensure the bunker
team is ready for the operation.
Inattention, poor communication, and fatigue can result in
bunkering accidents.
13

BUNKER PROCEDURE CHECKLIST:
When Bunkers Arrive
Vessel access
‚òê Make sure a ladder, or
other means of access,
meets safety of life at
sea (SOLAS) standards
and is securely in
place between vessel
and delivering vessel
or facility. For more
information about safe
access, go to page 30.
Pre-transfer conference with delivery person
‚òê Establish a means of two-way communication with the
delivering vessel or facility. For example: hand held radio,
air horns, or sound-powered telephones.
‚òê PICs must meet face-to-face aboard either vessel or facility
to complete the declaration of inspection.
‚òê Discuss topping-off procedures.
Safe access is provided with the
accommodation ladder.
14

‚òê Discuss emergency shutdown procedures with delivery
person, including emergency shutdown signal.
‚òê Identify personnel serving as point-of-transfer and deck-
rover watches to the delivering PIC.
‚òê Master, or PIC, must enter pre-transfer conference in
official log or deck log.
‚òê Discuss the maximum transfer rate for each particular
stage of bunkering. For example: starting, steady flow and
topping-off.
Ensure:
‚òê All the scupper plugs
are installed and
tightened.
‚òê All valves are lined
up correctly. Valves
to unused tanks are
closed.
‚òê Everyone is rested,
knows what to do,
and is ready to start.
‚òê Any overflow tanks
are empty and their high-level switches or pipeline flow
switches are working.
‚òê All level gauges, level alarms, and remote-operated valves
are known to be working correctly.
‚òê All declaration of inspection and pre-loading plans are
saved for at least 30 days.
When bunkering begins:
‚òê Start slowly and confirm oil is entering into the expected
tank(s) before increasing the loading rate.
Check all scupper plugs to avoid
accidental spills.
15

BUNKER PROCEDURE CHECKLIST:
During Bunkering
Inattention during tank level monitoring, and the improper
aligning of valves, are the most common causes of oil spills
during transfers. Ensure that your transfer procedures and
training emphasize the importance of these transfer basics.

Everyone must follow the plan. If something changes:
‚Ä¢ Stop the bunkering.
‚Ä¢ Adjust the plan.
‚Ä¢ Communicate the plan changes to everyone, including
the tankerman.
‚Ä¢ Post the new plan at the point-of-transfer.
‚Ä¢ Resume bunkering under the new plan.
During bunkering operations
‚òê Align valves to ensure flow to the correct tank(s). Make
sure valves to unused tanks are closed.
‚òê Ensure two-way communication with delivering vessel or
facility.
‚òê Maintain two-way communication with the bunker team.
‚òê Notify the delivering vessel or facility before changing
tanks and topping-off.
‚òê Make sure bunkering personnel perform duties as
required.
‚òê Ensure no team member exceeds work hour restrictions.
‚òê Compare deliverer‚Äôs rate to receiving rate. If there is
a significant difference, shut down immediately and
investigate.
16

‚òê The receiving vessel‚Äôs PIC should compare the calculated
transfer rate to the planned rate and, if the transfer rate is
higher than planned, the PIC should contact the delivering
vessel or facility immediately to reduce it.
Do not exceed the planned transfer rate without
considering potential impacts to safety. Increased
transfer rates require more attention and
communication. If the PIC chooses to exceed the
planned rate, they have more responsibility to make sure
the transfer operation remains safe and free of spills.
‚òê If the oil transfer rate exceeds the planned rate, the
delivering PIC should notify the receiving vessel‚Äôs PIC and
decrease the transfer rate.
‚òê Allow ample time to complete the operation at a safe
transfer rate when scheduling the bunkering operation.
Time constraints should not drive the need for an increased
transfer rate.
‚òê Company policies and procedures for bunkering should
clearly place safety and environmental protection over
commercial considerations.
Additional information
‚úì Verify, by frequent observations, that all fuel system tank
levels are as expected. If using the ship‚Äôs electronic tank
gauging system during the bunkering operation, verify the
electronic system is accurate with manual soundings before
and/or during bunkering.
It is better to restart a
bunkering operation than
clean up after a spill.
Never hesitate to STOP
bunkering to avoid a spill.
17

BUNKER PROCEDURE CHECKLIST:
After Bunkering
Complete the following:
‚òê Close header valve.
‚òê Drain hoses before disconnecting.
‚òê Close all bunker system valves.
‚òê Blank bunker hose before returning to delivering vessel or
facility. Thoroughly clean hose flange before blanking.
‚òê Blank bunker header flange.
‚òê Take final soundings of all fuel oil tanks to ensure ample
space for expansion.
‚òê Properly complete oil record book, deck, and engine log
books.
‚òê Save the written pre-loading plan and declaration of
inspection for at least 30 days.

Washington State waters are valued for their natural beauty,
cultural significance, commerce, recreation and bounty of
seafood they provide. An oil spill can harm the environment
and put public health and the economy at risk. Impacts
from oil spills can be immediate and catastrophic, or longer
term and chronic, causing lingering contamination.
An oil spill can harm the tiniest microscopic plants and
animals, as well as largest marine mammals, such as whales.
Fish and wildlife habitat can be destroyed. Oil can remain in
the environment for days or years, causing long-term injury.
While some types of oil may not appear as harmful as
others, the toxicity, mechanical injury, and persistence of oil
make all types of spills potentially damaging or destructive.
Acute toxicity
Acute toxicity is a measure of a substance‚Äôs ability to cause
severe biological harm or death soon after a single exposure.
Volatile compounds in oil can readily dissolve into water
and evaporate into the air, posing an immediate threat to life
in the water and on the land. While all petroleum products
have some level of toxicity, marine diesel fuel/marine gas oil
is one type of highly toxic oil.

Mechanical injury
Mechanical injury is a measure of how much harm oil
causes because of its physical characteristics. This is
sometimes called the ‚Äúcoating‚Äù effect because oils which are
thick and sticky (viscous) tend to coat plants and animals to
a level that causes physical injury, such as loss of insulation,
immobility, or smothering.
Bunker fuel/Intermediate Fuel Oil (IFO)-380 and
lubricating oils (grease, gear oil, motor oil, hydraulic oil,
and mineral oil) are several types of viscous oil.
Persistence
Persistence is a measure of how long oil stays in the
environment before breaking down. Oils with high
persistence tend to contaminate habitats longer and pose
ongoing threats to organisms that rely on these habitats.
Persistence is also a measure of chronic, or long term,
toxicity. Certain compounds in oil can persist in the
environment for months or years following a spill.
Many oils have components called polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs). Some types of PAHs cause long
term, sub-lethal, chronic effects to an organism‚Äôs growth,
reproduction, and survival, which can harm populations
over time.
Bunker fuel/ IFO-380 and lubricating oils are persistent and
remain in the environment for several years.

Summary of oil qualities by type
Bunker fuel/Intermediate Fuel Oil (IFO)-380
Acute
toxicity
Few volatile compounds, generally not very acutely
toxic. Adding diesel or other solvents increases
acute toxicity. Some IFOs increase in acute toxicity
with exposure to sunlight.
Mechanical

Very viscous and sticky; major threat.
Persistence
Very persistent; can remain in the environment for
over ten years.

oil, and mineral oil)
Acute
toxicity
No volatile compounds. Low acute toxicity.
Mechanical
injury

Persistence
Moderately persistent; generally remain
a few years in the environment.
Marine diesel fuel/marine gas oil
Acute
toxicity
Can contain high to moderate levels of volatile
compounds; acutely toxic to animal life.
Mechanical

RESOURCES:
Lessons Learned from Bunkering Spills
To find the most common causes of bunkering spills, we
conduct in-depth investigations on many spills. These
recommendations are based on lessons learned and will help
crews avoid spills.
Training and awareness
‚Ä¢ Crew should understand the importance of getting
enough rest and the dangers of working while
fatigued.
‚Ä¢ The PIC should be familiar with the vessel‚Äôs oil
transfer procedures, the fuel piping system, and the
status of the piping, valves, and fuel tanks before
fueling.
‚Ä¢ Vessel crew must receive training as required
by Washington‚Äôs rules for safe bunkering, and
be prepared to carry out their duties as part of a
bunkering team.
‚Ä¢ The PIC should ensure the bunkering team
understands the importance of closely watching the
vents of fuel tanks, especially when those tanks are
topped-off.
Communication
‚Ä¢ Delivering and receiving PICs should carefully
review and discuss the pre-loading plan.
‚Ä¢ At the end of the transfer, when draining a fuel hose
into a vessel‚Äôs tank, the delivering and receiving PICs
should work together to make sure fuel does not
burp out through the tank vents.
‚Ä¢ If an oil spill occurs, delivering and receiving PICs
should use available communication systems, such
as voice, radio, or air horn, to immediately notify all
involved crew.
22

Procedures and cautions
‚Ä¢ Crew, including the PICs, must have enough rest
prior to fueling operations.
‚Ä¢ The receiving vessel‚Äôs PIC should prepare a pre-
loading plan for bunkering that includes a planned
transfer rate. The planned rate should meet
company standards, be at or below the maximum
rate allowable for the tanks to be filled, and consider
the time it takes for ship‚Äôs crew to detect and correct
any problems.
‚Ä¢ Sound fuel tanks at regular intervals that fit the
bunker operation and the stage of bunkering taking
place. For example, take soundings during the
starting, steady flow, and topping-off stages. Record
soundings and retain records in the bunkering file.
‚Ä¢ The receiving vessel‚Äôs PIC should compare the
calculated transfer rate to the planned rate. If the
transfer rate is higher than planned, the PIC should
contact the delivering vessel or facility immediately
to reduce it. The receiving vessel‚Äôs PIC must
frequently calculate and record the rate of transfer
based on the soundings. Record transfer rates in the
bunkering file.
23
Sounding tape near the fuel
tank sounding location.
Planned transfer rate.

Vessel oil transfer procedures should:
‚Ä¢ Describe the duties of each person involved in fueling
operations by position or title.
‚Ä¢ Assign the deck-rover to specifically watch the deck
and vents for oil spills.
‚Ä¢ State the level at which topping-off begins and the
maximum fill level for each fuel tank.
‚Ä¢ State the maximum rates for safely filling and for
topping-off each fuel tank.
‚Ä¢ Describe special or unusual parts or behaviors of the
fuel tanks or their fill and vent piping.
‚Ä¢ Describe added steps needed to keep fueling safe
when the vessel‚Äôs trim or list is unusual.
‚Ä¢ Have a pre-loading plan that includes the items
required by Washington‚Äôs rules.
‚Ä¢ Require that PICs complete all parts of the pre-
loading plan before each fuel transfer.
‚Ä¢ Require a check of the fuel oil piping and valve line-
up before starting any fuel transfer.
‚Ä¢ Describe procedures for regularly checking the fuel
tank levels.
‚Ä¢ Require fuel tank level checks at the start of transfer
operations to make sure that fuel is only going into
the expected tanks.
‚Ä¢ Require fuel tank level checks after closing the valves
of each filled tank to ensure that the fuel levels do not
change.
‚Ä¢ Conduct only one oil transfer at a time unless the
PICs use more people to make sure both transfers
happen safely.
24

Equipment
‚Ä¢ Identify ‚Äúproblem‚Äù fuel oil tanks prone to burps,
overflows, or other issues for each vessel based on
experience. The vessel operator should identify the
cause of the problems and fix them.
‚Ä¢ All fuel system valves, manifolds, and piping should
be marked clearly with their use and the tanks they
serve.
‚Ä¢ Maintain easy-to-read fuel system markings.
‚Ä¢ Vessel fuel oil valves and manifolds should be well-
lit so the PIC can see what they are for and if they
are open or closed.
‚Ä¢ When using sight glasses to check tank fuel levels,
consider having the topping-off and maximum safe-
fill levels clearly marked on the sight glass or the
bulkhead next to it.
‚Ä¢ Post an up-to-date line drawing of the fuel oil
system at each of the vessel‚Äôs fuel manifolds.

Fatigue & Maritime Operations
Bunkering by fatigued crew can cause oil spills. In
Washington State, fatigue has been a factor in a number of
bunker spills. Though sleep is a basic human need, fatigue
and the need for sleep are too often viewed as weaknesses that
can be overcome. In reality, fatigue is not controllable, and
it leads to a degradation of performance and poor decision-
making.
There are many misconceptions about fatigue and the need
for sleep, including:
MisconceptionReality
‚ÄúI know how
tired I am.‚Äù
Since fatigue impairs all mental
functions, including perception, people
consistently underestimate their levels
of fatigue.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve been
awake this long
before with no
problem.‚Äù
The body‚Äôs natural sleep rhythms are
complex and subject to a variety of
factors. Do not assume that because you
stayed awake for a long period without
incident you can safely repeat the
experience.
‚ÄúIf I drink
coffee, I‚Äôll stay
awake with no
problem.‚Äù
Caffeine‚Äôs effect is temporary (three
to four hours), and those who drink
caffeinated beverages regularly
experience less of a stimulant effect
over time. In addition, once the
stimulant effects have worn off, you
may experience a ‚Äúrebound effect‚Äù and
be even more fatigued. Stimulants such
as caffeine can also degrade your sleep
quality.
28

A number of fatigue-related effects have been identified:
‚Ä¢ Lapses in judgment or failures to respond.
‚Ä¢ Inappropriate responses.
‚Ä¢ Decreased performance consistency.
‚Ä¢ Slowed reactions.
‚Ä¢ Increased mental errors.
‚Ä¢ Decreased memory and recall.
‚Ä¢ Decreased attention.
‚Ä¢ Increased risk-taking behavior.

‚ÄúVessel personnel involved in bunkering may not work
more than 15 hours in any 24-hour period, nor more
than 36 hours in any 72-hour period, except in an
emergency or spill response operation. For purposes of
this section, ‚Äòemergency‚Äô means an unforeseen situation
that poses an imminent threat to human safety, or the
environment, or substantial loss of property.‚Äù
Crew work and rest hour records must be available, upon
request by the state inspector, to confirm compliance.
Fatigue plays a major role in oil spills during
bunkering.

RESOURCES:
Safe Access to Vessels
Safe access to vessels is important for personnel safety
During bunkering operations, certain crew need access
to the vessel. It is important the gangway, brow, or ladder
access points are strong, stable, clean, and well-lit to avoid
potential injuries.
Accidents that occur while accessing a vessel can result in
serious injuries and loss of life. Safety issues include:
‚Ä¢ Loose and unstable gangway handrails and ropes.
‚Ä¢ Vertical ladders that are not secured or attended at the
top and/or bottom.
‚Ä¢ Inadequate lighting.
‚Ä¢ Oily or slick ladder treads or gangway.
Example of vessel access from a barge during a transfer.

Legal requirements for access during bunker and oil
transfer operations
For bunkering operations, WAC 317-40-050 requires vessels
to have an accommodation ladder between the vessel and
facility or to another vessel. If the ladder is inaccessible,
another means of access that meets SOLAS standards, such as
a pilot‚Äôs ladder, can be used instead.
Why safe access matters
Personnel injuries and accidents, including loss of life,
have occurred because access to the vessel was unsafe.
Understanding which arrangements are safe and acceptable,
and which are not, can prevent future accidents.
Secure the access platform at the top and bottom to keep it
from moving.
Keep the entire ladder and access points from the vessel and
facility well-lit during low visibility conditions.

RESOURCES:
Cell Phone Use & Maritime Operations
When used appropriately, mobile phones can be useful
tools for those in the marine industry. However, when used
inappropriately, they can be dangerous distractions that can
lead to marine accidents and oil spills.
Recommendations
Your company‚Äôs safety management system (SMS) operations
manual should set rules for mobile phone use by on-duty
crew. The rules should, at a minimum:
‚Ä¢ Restrict mobile phone use by on-duty crew to
operations-related calls.
‚Ä¢ Set time limits for calls that allow for only brief,
important conversations.
‚Ä¢ Identify locations and circumstances when on-duty
mobile phone calls are permitted, or are not permitted.
Choose the best approach for your operation.
‚Ä¢ Outline procedures for on-duty crew to get relief if they
receive an emergency personal phone call.
Bunkering spills related to mobile phone use
These spills occurred in Washington State and involved use of
mobile phones.
‚Ä¢ The sole navigation watchstander was in charge of both
monitoring for spills during an internal fuel transfer
and acting as a lookout for a tugboat pulling a laden tug
barge. The barge was near ferry lanes in Puget Sound.
The watchstander was busy with back-to-back mobile
phone calls for about 19 minutes and failed to notice
oil spilling from the fuel transfer operation. About 200
gallons of diesel spilled into Washington waters before
the watch stander noticed the spill and stopped the
transfer.
32

‚Ä¢ The engineer in charge of fueling a tugboat was talking on
a mobile phone while topping-off one of the tanks with
diesel. The engineer on the delivering vessel saw him on
the phone and reproached him because personal mobile
phone use was against company policy. The engineer then
hung up the phone and went below to close the valve to
one tank and open a valve to another, but it was too late.
When he returned to the deck, diesel was already spilling
from the tank he was topping off. About five gallons
spilled to Washington waters.
Research examples of mobile phone hazards
Bunkering activities and activities related to operating an
automobile both require concentration and sustained focus.
Because of this similarity, research about mobile phone
hazards from the automobile industry can also inform the
maritime community.
‚Ä¢ A study\* found that automobile driver performance while
talking on a mobile phone was comparable to driving
while under the influence of alcohol at the legal limit.
‚Ä¢ According to the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA), driving an automobile
while using a mobile phone can pose a serious mental
distraction and degrade driver performance. NHTSA
estimates that driver distraction from all sources
contributes to 25% of all police-reported traffic crashes.
‚Ä¢ Both hands-free and hand-held mobile phones cause
mental distraction that are significant enough to decrease
the performance of drivers, causing them to miss key
visual and audio cues needed to avoid collisions.
Other portable electronic devices
You should also consider these factors when setting rules for
the use of other electronic devices.
