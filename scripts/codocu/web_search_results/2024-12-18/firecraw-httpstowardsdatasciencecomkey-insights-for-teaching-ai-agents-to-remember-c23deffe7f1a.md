Memory is undoubtedly becoming a crucial aspect of Agentic AI. As the use cases for AI Agents grow in complexity, so does the need for these agents to learn from past experiences, utilize stored business-specific knowledge, and adapt to evolving scenarios based on accumulated information.

In my previous article, ‚Äú [Memory in AI: Key Benefits and Investment Considerations](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/the-important-role-of-memory-in-agentic-ai-896b22542b3e),‚Äù I explored why memory is pivotal for AI, discussing its role in recall, reasoning, and continuous learning. This piece, however, will dive directly into the implementation of memory by examining its impact through the ‚Äúteachability‚Äù functionality in the popular agent framework, [Autogen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/).

**_Note_** _:_ _While this article is technical in nature, it offers value for both technical professionals and business leaders looking to evaluate the role of memory in Agentic AI systems. I‚Äôve structured it so that readers can skip over the code sections and still grasp the way memory can augment the responses of your AI systems. If you don‚Äôt wish to follow the code, you may read the descriptions of each step to get a sense of the process‚Ä¶ or just the key findings and recommendations section._

# Key Findings and Recommendations

My exploration of Autogen‚Äôs Teachable Agents revealed both their potential and limitations in handling both simple and complex memory tasks.

Out of the box, Autogen‚Äôs TeachableAgent performs less brilliantly than expected. The Agen‚Äôts reasoning ability conflates memories together in a non productive way and the included retrieval mechanism is not set up for multi-step searches necessary for answering complex questions. **This limitation suggests that if you would like to use Autogen‚Äôs Teachable Agents, there needs to be substantial customization to both supplement reasoning capabilities and achieve more sophisticated memory retrieval.**

**To build more robust memory capabilities, it‚Äôs crucial to implement multi-step search functionality.** A single memory search often falls short of providing the comprehensive information needed for complex tasks. Implementing a series of interconnected searches could significantly enhance the agent‚Äôs ability to gather and synthesize relevant information.

**The ‚Äúteachability‚Äù feature, while powerful, should be approached with caution**. **Continuous activation without oversight risks data poisoning and compromise of trusted information sources**. Business leaders and solution architects should consider implementing a human-in-the-loop approach, allowing users to approve what the system learns versus treating every inference as ground truth the system should learn from. This oversight in Autogen‚Äôs current Teachable Agent design could cause significant risks associated with unchecked learning.

Lastly, the method of memory retrieval from a knowledge store plays a large role in the system‚Äôs effectiveness. **Moving beyond simple nearest neighbor searches, which is the TeachableAgent‚Äôs default, to more advanced techniques such as hybrid search** (combining keyword and vector approaches), **semantic search, or knowledge graph utilization** **could dramatically improve the relevance and accuracy of retrieved information**.

# Descriptive Code Implementation

To appropriately demonstrate how external memory can be valuable, I created a fictitious scenario for a car parts manufacturing plant. Follow the code below to implement a Teachable Agent yourself.

**_Scenario_** _: A car parts manufacturing facility needs to put a plan in place in case there are energy constraints. The plan needs to be flexible and adapt based on how much power consumption the facility can use and which parts and models are in demand._

**Step 1:**

Pre- set up requires you to pip install autogen if you don‚Äôt have it installed in your active environment and create a config JSON file.

Example of a compatible config file which uses Azure OpenAI‚Äôs service model GPT4‚Äìo:

```
[{\
    "model": "gpt-4o",\
    "api_key": "<YOUR API KEY>",\
    "azure_endpoint": "<YOUR ENDPOINT>",\
    "api_type": "azure",\
    "api_version": "2024-06-01"\
}]
```

Install Autogen for python:

```
pip install pyautogen
```

**Step 2:**

Import the necessary libraries to your notebook or file and load the config file.

```
import autogen
from autogen.agentchat.contrib.capabilities.teachability import Teachability
from autogen import ConversableAgent, UserProxyAgent

config_list = autogen.config_list_from_json(
    env_or_file="autogenconfig.json", #the json file name that stores the config
    file_location=".", #this means the file is in the same directory
    filter_dict={
        "model": ["gpt-4o"], #select a subset of the models in your config
    },
)
```

**Step 3:**

Create the Agents. We will need two agents because of the way that Autogen‚Äôs framework works. We use a UserProxyAgent to execute tasks and interact with or replace human involvement (depending on the desired amount of human in the loop). We also create a Conversable Agent as the ‚ÄúTeachable Agent‚Äù which is meant to interact with other agents (not the user). You can read more about the [UserProxyAgents](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/reference/agentchat/user_proxy_agent/) and [ConversableAgents](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/reference/agentchat/conversable_agent/) here.

```
teachable_agent = ConversableAgent(
    name="teachable_agent",  # the name can't contain spaces
    llm_config={"config_list": config_list, "timeout": 120, "cache_seed": None},  # in this example we disable caching but if it is enabled it caches API requests so that they can be reused when the same request is used
)

user = UserProxyAgent(
    name="user",
    human_input_mode="ALWAYS", #I want to have full control over the code executed so I am setting human_input_mode to ALWAYS. Other options are NEVER and TERMINATE.
    is_termination_msg=lambda x: True if "TERMINATE" in x.get("content") else False, #setting a termination  message is VERY important because it tells the agent when to finish.
    max_consecutive_auto_reply=0, #we don't need this agent to replies multiple times in a row
    code_execution_config={
        "use_docker": False
    },  # If you are planning on running code look into setting use_docker=True. For this example I am not because then I have to walk through the docker setup, but it is safer than running the code directly.
)
```

**Step 4:**

To have a baseline, let‚Äôs ask the same question to the agents before and after we ‚Äúteach‚Äù it. I purposely decided to demonstrate different levels of question difficulty to show performance on tasks that require a single step vs multistep memory retrieval. To successfully address the intricate multi-step question, the retrieval mechanism must provide information from two separate memories as context to the language model responsible for generating a final response.

**Simple Question**: ‚ÄúThe facility is experiencing a power shortage of 40%. What models need to be prioritized?‚Äù

**Complex Multi Step Question**: ‚ÄúThe facility is experiencing a power shortage of 40%. Provide me a detailed breakdown of what machines should be deactivated and which machines should remain active.‚Äù

As expected the responses are generic and not particularly applicable to an individual business.

**Response prior to enabling long term memory:**

teachable_agent (to user):

To address a power shortage of 30% effectively, it's crucial to prioritize models that are essential to critical operations, safety, and those that have the highest impact on productivity. Here are steps to determine which models to prioritize:

1. **Identify Essential Systems:** Prioritize systems that are vital for safety, security, and essential operations. These might include:
   - Emergency lighting
   - Security systems (alarms, surveillance)
   - Critical environmental controls (e.g., refrigeration for hazardous materials)
   - Communication systems

2. **Evaluate Impact on Core Operations:** Determine which models are crucial to the facility‚Äôs core functions. This can include machinery, servers, or any processes that are indispensable for maintaining productivity and operations.

3. **Energy Efficiency:** Prioritize models and equipment that are more energy-efficient and can operate within the reduced power capacity.

4. **Downtime Cost:** Consider the cost of downtime for each model. Prioritize those where downtime would result in significant financial losses or production delays.

Based on these principles, here‚Äôs a generic prioritization framework:

1. **Safety and Security Systems:**
   - Emergency Lighting
   - Fire Alarms and Sprinkler Systems
   - Security Cameras and Sensors

2. **Critical Operational Systems:**
   - Essential Production Machinery (that cannot be shut down without major issues)
   - Servers and IT Infrastructure (especially those critical for operations and data integrity)
   - HVAC Systems (if necessary for maintaining safe operating conditions)

3. **Support Systems:**
   - Backup Power Systems (uninterruptible power supplies, generators)
   - Communication Systems (both internal and external communication)

Ensure that non-essential and high energy-consuming equipment is powered down or scheduled to operate during off-peak hours if possible.

Always re-evaluate periodically to ensure that the power allocation aligns with the dynamic needs of the facility. Communication with key stakeholders regarding priorities and decisions is also essential for smooth operations during a power shortage.

COMPLEX MULTISTEP QUESTION RESPONSE

2. Redundant IT systems
3. Non-critical HVAC and lighting
4. Office equipment in non-essential areas

**Note**: These recommendations should be adjusted based on the specific operational requirements of your facility. Additionally, it could be beneficial to communicate these changes to all staff to ensure compliance and understanding.
```

Code to ask baseline questions:

```

#simple question
user.initiate_chat(teachable_agent, message="The facility is experiencing a power shortage of 40%. What models need to be prioritized?", clear_history=True)
#multistep complex question
user.initiate_chat(teachable_agent, message="The facility is experiencing a power shortage of 30%. Provide me a detailed breakdown of what machines should be deactivated and which machines should remain active.", clear_history=True)
```

**Step 5:**

Create the ‚Äúteachability‚Äù capability that you then add to the agent. The Teachability class inherits from the AgentCapabiliy class, which essentially allows you to add customizable capabilities to the Agents.

The Teachability class has many optional parameters that can be further explored [here](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/notebook/agentchat_teachability.ipynb).

The out of the box Teachability class is a quick and convenient way of adding long term memory to the agents, but will likely need to be customized for use in a production setting, as outlined in the key findings section. It involves sending messages to an Analyzer Agent that evaluates the user messages for potential storage and retrieval. The Analyzer Agent looks for advice that could be applicable to similar tasks in the future and then summarizes and stores task-advice pairs in a binary database serving as the agent‚Äôs ‚Äúmemory‚Äù.

```
teachability = Teachability(
    verbosity=0,  # 0 for basic info, 1 to add memory operations, 2 for analyzer messages, 3 for memo lists.
    reset_db=True, # we want to reset the db because we are creating a new agent so we don't want any existing memories. If we wanted to use an existing memory store we would set this to false.
    path_to_db_dir="./tmp/notebook/teachability_db", #this is the default path you can use any path you'd like
    recall_threshold=1.5,  # Higher numbers allow more (but less relevant) memos to be recalled.
    max_num_retrievals=10 #10 is default bu you can set the max number of memos to be retrieved lower or higher
)

teachability.add_to_agent(teachable_agent)
```

**Step 6:**

Now that the teachable\_agent is configured, we need to provide it the information that we want the agent to ‚Äúlearn‚Äù (store in the database and retrieve from).

In line with our scenario, I wanted the agent to have basic understanding of the facility which consisted of:

- the types of components the manufacturing plant produces
- the types of car models the components need to be made for
- which machines are used to make each component

Additionally, I wanted to provide some operational guidance on the priorities of the facility depending on how power constrained it is. This includes:

- Guidance in case of energy capacity constraint of more than 50%
- Guidance in case of energy capacity constraint between 25‚Äì50%
- Guidance in case of energy capacity constraint between 0‚Äì25%

**Results after implementing long term memory:**

The Teachable Agent was able to partially answer the simple question. It was correct on the car models that need to be prioritized, but it provided additional incorrect information about which components needed to be included.

The complex multi-step question was not adequately addressed. It erroneously merged two distinct business guidelines for 0‚Äì25% and 25‚Äì50% capacity constraints into a single, generalized guideline, resulting in an inaccurate response. Additionally, it only provided a partial list of machines that should remain active or be deactivated for each component‚Äôs production, omitting crucial details from the complete operational protocol. This demonstrates the challenges in accurately retrieving and synthesizing information from multiple, separate memory sources for complex queries.

- **Brake Caliper Milling Machine**:
  - Machining of brake calipers, essential for Ford F-150 and Ford Explorer.
- **Brake Pad Press**:
  - Manufacturing of brake pads, necessary for ensuring braking efficiency in Ford F-150 and Ford Explorer.

#### Deactivated Machines:
- **Door Stamping Machine**:
  - While important, body panels like doors are less critical than engine and transmission components under current constraints.
- **Hood Assembly Machine**:
  - Deactivating hood assembly to free up power for critical components manufacturing.
- **Fender Bending Machine**:
  - Non-critical compared to engine and brake components during a significant power shortage.
- **Coil Spring Forming Machine**:
  - Suspension springs are lower priorities under current circumstances.
- **Shock Absorber Assembly Line**:
  - Suspension components aren‚Äôt critical enough to keep operational during this level of power shortage.

This plan ensures that production focuses on maintaining the critical components needed for primary models, the Ford F-150 and Ford Explorer, thereby maximizing the utility of the remaining power while managing production constraints effectively.
```

Code:

```
#simple question
user.initiate_chat(teachable_agent, message="The facility is experiencing a power shortage of 40%. What models need to be prioritized?", clear_history=True)
#multistep complex question
user.initiate_chat(teachable_agent, message="The facility is experiencing a power shortage of 30%. Provide me a detailed breakdown of what machines should be deactivated and which machines should remain active.", clear_history=True)
```

# Conclusion

While Autogen provides a straightforward introduction to AI systems with memory, it falls short in handling complex tasks effectively.

**_When developing your own AI Agent System with memory capabilities, consider focusing on these key capabilities_** _:_

- **Implement multi-step searches** to ensure comprehensive and relevant results. This allows the agent to assess the usefulness of search outcomes and address all aspects of a query using the retrieved information. Additionally, **consider using more advanced retrieval approaches** such as semantic search, hybrid search, or knowledge graphs for the best results.
- To limit the potential for data poisoning, **develop a thoughtful approach to who should be able to ‚Äúteach‚Äù the agent and when the agent should ‚Äúlearning‚Äù**. Based on guidelines set by the business or developer, one can also use agent reasoning to determine if something should be added to memory and by whom.
- Remove the likelihood of retrieving out of date information by **adding a memory decaying mechanism** that determines when a memory is no longer relevant or a newer memory should replace it.
- **For multi-agent systems** involving group chats or inter-agent information sharing, **explore various communication patterns**. Determine the most effective methods for transferring supplemental knowledge and establish limits to prevent information overload.
