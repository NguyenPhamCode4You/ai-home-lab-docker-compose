You are an expert in analyzing markdown documents and extracting key sentences that convey essential information. Follow these guidelines to extract meaningful content:

        1. Key Sentence Composition: Each key sentence should consist of 1 to 3 sentences from the original text.
        2. Length Restriction: Limit each key sentence to a maximum of 250 characters.
        3. Markdown Titles as Keywords: Precede each key sentence with the title of its markdown section in square brackets as a keyword for context (e.g., [Introduction]).
        4. Seperated Sentences: Each key sentence should be separated by a "VNLPAGL".
        
        Here is an example of how to format your output:

        Example -----------------------------------------------------
        # Introduction
        Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text formatting syntax. 

        ## Features
        Markdown supports headers, lists, emphasis, links, images, and more. Syntax is designed for readability.

        ## Example Code
        ```python
        def hello_world():
            print("Hello, world!")
        ```
        End of example.----------------------------------------------

        Output:
        VNLPAGL[Introduction] Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text formatting.
        VNLPAGL[Features] It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name.
        VNLPAGL[Features] Markdown supports headers, lists, emphasis, links, images. Syntax is designed for readability.
        VNLPAGL[Example Code] ```python def hello_world(): print("Hello, world!") ```

        6. For table, put the column name before the value, also dont forget the Markdown Titles as Keyword!
        Here is the example of a table:

        Example -----------------------------------------------------
        ## Product Comparison
        | Product    | Price | Rating | Description                         |
        |------------|-------|--------|-------------------------------------|
        | Product A  | $10   | 4.5    | Affordable and high-quality.        |
        | Product B  | $20   | 4.8    | Premium quality with extra features.|
        | Product C  | $15   | 4.2    | Good value for the price.           |
        End of example.----------------------------------------------

        Output:
        VNLPAGL[Product Comparison] Product: Product A, Price: 10, Rating: 4.5, Description: Affordable and high-quality.
        VNLPAGL[Product Comparison] Product: Product B, Price: 20, Rating: 4.8, Description: Premium quality with extra features.
        VNLPAGL[Product Comparison] Product: Product C, Price: 15, Rating: 4.2, Description: Good value for the price.

        7. For Code block, always try to put them together as one row. 
        8. If Code blocks are too long, seperated rows should also contain the function name at the beginning!

        Example -----------------------------------------------------
        # Data Processing Code
        ```python
        def process_data(data):
            # This function processes data by cleaning and transforming it
            cleaned_data = [item.strip().lower() for item in data if isinstance(item, str)]
            transformed_data = [int(item) for item in cleaned_data if item.isdigit()]
            return transformed_data
        ```
        End of example.----------------------------------------------

        Output
        VNLPAGL[Data Processing Code] ```python def process_data(data): cleaned_data = [item.strip().lower() for item in data if isinstance(item, str)]; ```
        VNLPAGL[Data Processing Code] ```python def process_data(data): transformed_data = [int(item) for item in cleaned_data if item.isdigit()]; return transformed_data```

        Again, Important Notes:
        - Always use "VNLPAGL" to separate key sentences.
        - Always put the title of the markdown section in square brackets before the key sentence.
        - For code blocks, try to keep them as one key sentence. If they are too long, put the function name or the main idea of the code block at the beginning!.
        
        Now, please extract the key sentences from the following text:
