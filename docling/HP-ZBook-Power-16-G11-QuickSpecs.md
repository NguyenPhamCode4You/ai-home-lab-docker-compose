* Wi-Fi 6E requires a Wi-Fi 6E router, sold separately, and Windows 11 to function in the 6GHz band. Availability of public wireless access points limited. Wi-Fi 6E is backwards compatible with prior 802.11 specs. And available in countries where Wi-Fi 6E is supported.

[2] Check latest software/driver release for updates on supported security features.

[3] The FCC has declared as of September 1, 2014 products that utilize passive scanning on channel

12/13 and are capable of transmitting must fully comply with requirements of 15.247 or otherwise disable those channels.

[4] Receiver sensitivity is measured at a packet error rate of 8% for 802.11b (CKK modulation) and a packet error rate of 10% for 802.11a/g (OFDM modulation).

*Mobile Broadband is an optional feature. Connection requires wireless data service contract, network support, and is not available in all areas. Contact service provider to determine the coverage area and availability. Connection speeds will vary due to location, environment, network conditions, and other factors. 4G LTE not available on all products or in all countries.

**Gigabit class Category 16 4G LTE module is optional and must be configured at the factory. Module designed for up to 1 Gbps download speeds as carriers deploy 5 carrier aggregation and 100Mhz channel bandwidth, requires activation and separately purchased service contract. Backwards compatible to HSPA 3G technologies. Check with service provider for coverage and availability in your area. Connection, upload and download speeds will vary due to network, location, environment, network conditions, and other factors. 4G LTE not available on all products, in all regions.

**Recharges up to 50% within 30 minutes when the system is off or in standby mode when used with the power adapter provided with the notebook. Power adapter minimum of 65 watts required for battery capacities 56Whr or less. Power adapter minimum of 100 watts required for battery capacities greater than 56Whr and less than 83Whr. Power adapter minimum of 120 watts required for battery capacities greater than 83Whr and less than 100Whr. After charging has reached 90% capacity, charging speed will return to normal. Charging time may vary +/-10% due to System tolerance.

RoHS Compliance

HP Inc. complies fully with materials regulations. We were among the first companies to extend the restrictions in the European Union (EU) Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) Directive to our products worldwide through the HP GSE. HP has contributed to the development of related legislation in Europe, as well as China, India, and Vietnam.

We believe the RoHS directive and similar laws play an important role in promoting industry- wide elimination of substances of concern. We have supported the inclusion of additional substances - including PVC, BFRs, and certain phthalates - in future RoHS legislation that pertains to electrical and electronics products.

We met our voluntary objective to achieve worldwide compliance with the new EU RoHS requirements for virtually all relevant products by July 2013, and we will continue to extend the scope of the commitment to include further restricted substances as regulations continue to evolve.

To obtain a copy of the HP RoHS Compliance Statement, see  HP RoHS position statement.
