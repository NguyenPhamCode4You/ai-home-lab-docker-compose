## I. Introduction

## I.1. About This Document

This  document  provides  guidance  and  best  practices  to  understand  and  implement  the calculations as set out under Regulation (EU) 2023/1805 1  (hereafter 'FuelEU'). Developed under  Workstream  1  (WS1)  of  the  Sustainable  Alternative  Power  for  Shipping  (SAPS) subgroup of the European Sustainable Shipping Forum (ESSF), it incorporates the collective knowledge and expert insights of the workstream members to explain and clarify formulas and requirements through actionable, detailed instructions.

The  primary  audience for this document is companies and organizations impacted by the FuelEU. This includes shipping companies (referred to as 'company' 2 ) directly responsible for  compliance,  as  well  as  entities  throughout  the  maritime  value  chain  affected  by  the regulation.  For  example,  marine  fuel  and  technology  suppliers  seeking  to  assess  the potential  compliance  surplus  or  deficit  associated  with  a  given  energy  product  under  the FuelEU.

This document provides detailed methods for calculating compliance with FuelEU Article 4 and  applying  flexibility  mechanisms in Article 20 and 21, namely banking, borrowing, and pooling. It  includes  practical  step-by-step  examples and calculation methodologies. Values used in the calculation examples are sourced from legislative texts or are illustrative values to  demonstrate  the  calculation  procedure.  In  practice,  values  that  are  not  fixed  in  the legislative  texts  should  align  with  the  certification  process  which  has  been  detailed  in  the SAPS  Workstream 2 (WS2) document titled 'Report on Marine Fuels Certification Procedures to support implementation of FuelEU.' 3

This  document  presents  the  legal  text  in  a  format  tailored  for  industry  implementation. Readers  should  note  that  only  the  referenced  legislative  texts  are  legally  binding.  Where interpretation of the legal requirements  is  necessary  to  support  practical  calculation methodologies,  it  is  clearly  identified  in  the  document.  The  development  of  calculation methodologies  was  based  on  industry  best  practices  and  expert  input  from  WS1.  While every  effort  has  been  made  to  ensure  accuracy  and consistency with the legislation and existing interpretations, it should be noted that  the  ultimate  authority  on  regulatory compliance  rests  with  the  EU  legislative  texts  and  the  Court  of  Justice  of  the  European Union.

## I.2. Scope of the Guidance Document

This document is designed to cover necessary aspects for understanding and implementing the compliance with Article 4 with greater explanation of the greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity

The  content  stems  from  extensive  consultations  and  collaboration  among ESSF experts, aiming for precision and practical applicability. While the guidance represents the industry's current understanding, it is not legally binding nor should it be considered investment advice. Values used in examples are solely to illustrate calculation methodologies and should not be interpreted as recommendations.

## I.3. Purpose of the Guidance

The  purpose  of  this  document  is  to  clarify  the  steps  needed  to  calculate  the  compliance balance laid out in Annex I, II, IV, and V of FuelEU as well as the steps for complying with flexibility  mechanisms  in  Articles  20  and  21.  It  provides  step-by-step  instructions  for stakeholders,  offering  practical  advice  and  detailed  breakdowns  of  the  provisions  in  the regulation.

## I.4. Overview of the FuelEU

Adopted  in  2023  and  published  in  the Official Journal of the EU on 22 September 2023, FuelEU is a pivotal component of the EU's strategy to reduce GHG emissions from maritime transport.  The regulation mandates the progressive use of renewable and low-carbon fuels to  decrease emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). It builds on the certification and GHG reduction framework developed under the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) to ensure a consistent approach to calculating emissions reductions across legislative texts.

Central  to  the  regulation  is  the  concept  of  Well-to-Wake  (WtW)  GHG  emissions,  which considers the full lifecycle emissions of maritime fuels. FuelEU specifies methodologies for

4 The FuelEU Maritime Regulation is a text with EEA relevance, which means that, following incorporation into the EEA Agreement, the Regulation will apply to EU Member States and Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway (except Svalbard).

calculating  the  GHG  intensity  of  energy  used  onboard  ships,  outlined  in  Annex  I,  and provides default emission factors in Annex II. These methodologies are critical for ensuring that all maritime fuels, whether  fossil-based or renewable,  are  assessed  fairly  and consistently.

The regulation also introduces a compliance balance mechanism, effective 1 January 2025. Verifiers annually calculate the attained GHG intensity for each ship, comparing it against a declining limit, or targets, set by the regulation. Figure 1 shows the GHG intensity limit which decreases  every  five  years,  requiring  gradual  improvement  in  GHG  intensity  and  the adoption of lower-emission technologies. Ships can engage in flexibility mechanisms such as banking surplus emissions reductions, borrowing future allowances, or pooling emissions with other ships to meet or exceed targets. For ships that fail to meet required GHG intensity (i.e., compliance balance in deficit), a financial penalty is imposed, calculated per metric ton of  deficit  emissions.  For  stakeholders  to  implement  the  requirements  requires  a  careful understanding of the FuelEU and associated legal texts.

## I.5. Legal  Framework  (FuelEU  and  Annex  I,  II,  IV  and  V Overview)

The calculation of the compliance balance is focused on several key FuelEU annexes, each outlining specific aspects of compliance:

- Annex I: Provides methodologies for calculating the GHG intensity of maritime fuels.
- Annex II: Lists default emission factors for various fuel types.
- Annex IV: Details requirements for monitoring and reporting emissions.

The European Sustainable Shipping Forum (ESSF) provides a platform for structural dialogue, exchange of technical knowledge, cooperation and coordination between the Commission, Member States' authorities and maritime transport stakeholders on issues pertaining to the sustainability and the competitiveness of EU maritime transport. This document has not

- Annex  V: Outlines provisions for verifying compliance with the regulation's standards.

Throughout  this  guidance,  examples of calculations based on the legal framework will be provided to illustrate how maritime operators can apply these rules in practice, facilitating a better understanding and implementation of the regulation. 5

In  addition  to  FuelEU,  the  guidance  also  points  to  other  EU  legislation  including  Directive (EU) 2018/2001, so-called Renewable  Energy  Directive  (RED)  as  well as relevant implementing acts and delegated regulations which are identified throughout this document.

## 1. Chapter 1: General Calculations and Principles

## 1.1. Introduction and Key Concepts

This chapter introduces the foundational concepts and calculations required to implement Article 4 of the FuelEU. Chapter 1 focuses on the most straightforward cases: vessels operating between or within ports of the European Economic Area (EEA), using fossil fuels, biofuels, or renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBOs). The EEA, comprising EU member states along with Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway (except Svalbard), defines the geographic scope of the regulation.

These cases serve to demonstrate the core principles and methodologies for understanding the application of the equations to calculate FuelEU compliance. Subsequent chapters build on this foundation by addressing how to apply the regulation to voyages involving non-EEA ports (Chapter 2), incorporating technologies such as wind-assisted propulsion or onshore power supply (Chapter 3), and applying flexibility mechanisms such as banking, borrowing, and pooling (Chapter 4).

Several key concepts are helpful to understanding the calculations:

- Compliance Balance :  The  measure of a ship's over- or under-compliance with the limits  for  the  yearly  average  GHG  intensity  of  the  energy used on board by a ship. This calculation is performed in accordance with Part A of Annex IV, as stipulated in Article 3(35) of FuelEU.
- E  value : The  total  GHG  emission  information  found  in  a  Proof  of  Sustainability (PoS),  as  issued  by  the  certified  fuel  supplier  to  demonstrate  compliance  with GHG/sustainability certification rules. The E value is regarded as a WtW figure under RED, as it reads 'from supply and use of the fuel (gCO2eq/MJ)'. 6  It is used in the FuelEU to determine the emission factor for non-fossil fuels.
- Extra-EEA: For  voyages between a port under the jurisdiction of an EEA Member State  and  a  port  under  the  jurisdiction  of  a  third  country  (or  vice-versa),  the Regulation applies to ships for one half of the energy used.
- GHG  Intensity : The well-to-wake (WtW) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated  with  the  energy  used  onboard  a  vessel,  expressed  in  grams  of  CO ₂ equivalent per megajoule (gCO ₂ eq/MJ). This metric accounts for all GHG emissions from  the  extraction  or  cultivation  of  raw  materials  through  to  fuel  combustion onboard. It includes emissions of carbon dioxide (CO ₂ ), methane (CH ₄ ), and nitrous oxide  (N ₂ O),  each  converted  into  CO ₂ equivalents  using  their  100-year  global warming potential (GWP). The WtW GHG intensity is composed of two parts:
- Well-to-tank (WtT) emissions : GHG  emissions from the extraction, production, and delivery of the fuel up to the point it is onboard the vessel.
- Tank-to-wake (TtW) emissions : GHG emissions from the combustion or use of  the  fuel  onboard  the  vessel,  including  any  methane  slip  or  fugitive emissions.

- Intra-EEA: The  Regulation  applies to ships for the entirety of the energy used on voyages between ports under the jurisdiction of EEA Member States as well as the energy used while the ship is at berth 7  and the energy used within EEA ports when the ship is not at berth (e.g., moving within a port of call between two voyages).
- LCV (Lower Calorific Value) : The amount of usable energy released when a fuel is combusted  as  expressed  in  megajoules  per  gram  (MJ/g),  and  reflecting  the  net energy content available for propulsion or onboard use.
- Proof of Compliance (PoC): A  solution  mentioned  in  EU ETS and MRV guidance document no.1 8  and endorsed by SAPS WS2, 9  for instances when the original PoS is not available, typically  because it has been surrendered to meet national targets. It provides equivalent sustainability and GHG data to support claims under FuelEU.
- Proof of Sustainability (PoS) :  A  sustainability  declaration  document  issued under an EU-approved  voluntary  scheme,  demonstrating  that a fuel  meets  RED  II sustainability  criteria.  It  includes  the fuel's well-to-wake GHG emissions (E value, in gCO ₂ eq/MJ) and is required under FuelEU for non-fossil fuels.
- Slip :  Non-combusted  fuel  that  escapes  as  fugitive  or  engine slip  emissions, most relevant for gaseous fuels such as LNG.

This chapter first outlines the general calculation principles for determining GHG intensity, followed by the methodology for calculating the compliance balance and associated penalties. It concludes with a series of examples demonstrating how these calculations are applied in practice.

## 1.2. GHG Intensity Calculation: Step-by-Step Guidance

## 1.2.1. Overview of the GHG intensity formulas

This section details the formulas and variables involved in the calculation of GHG intensity as  specified  in  FuelEU  Annex  I.  This  is  the  first  step  to  calculating  compliance  with  the FuelEU. While the fuel specific GHG intensity calculations in paragraph 1.2 of this guidance document are considered on a per metric tonne basis, it is important to note that the GHG emission intensity of each fuel is used to derive the annual weighted average WtW emission intensity of the ship's consumed energy.

According to the FuelEU, the following formula is used to calculate the GHG intensity of the energy consumed on board a ship:

Equation (1)

7 As per Article 3 of the MRV Maritime Regulation, a ship is to be considered at berth when 'securely moored or anchored in a port falling under the jurisdiction of a Member State while it is loading, unloading or hoteling, including the time spent when not engaged in cargo operations'. The ship will also be considered as 'at berth' when engaging in any operation other than cargo handling within port (e.g. bunkering, positioning,

inspections, etc.) between arrival at first berth and departure from last berth as long as the ship is securely moored or anchored within port limits.

For the calculation of the GHG intensity in carbon dioxide equivalences ( ) of the energy 𝐶𝑂 2𝑒𝑞 used onboard the ship (TtW), FuelEU mandates that companies should apply the GWP as defined over a period of 100 years in RED paragraph 4 of Part C of Annex V for all GHG types i.e., carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N 2 O).

Accordingly, the GWP100 values 11  to be used for FuelEU TtW calculations are:

Table 1. FuelEU TtW GWP100 values

## TtW emissions from slip

The  TtW  formula  and  the  table  in  FuelEU  Annex  II  account  for  fuel  slippage,  including fugitive  and  slipped  emissions (' Cslip ', as a percentage of mass, see table FuelEU Annex II column 9), if applicable. In case no slippage coefficient is provided in the table in FuelEU Annex II, it should be assumed as zero 13 . The slipped amount is a separate element in the TtW formula. While Cslip is deducted in the calculation of combusted fuel emissions, slip is separately accounted for by its impact on the total TtW emission intensity.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Note that the slip factors for CO 2 and N2O are set to 0 by FuelEU Annex 1, irrespective of the fuel class or pathway. The added slip emission intensity impact can therefore be simplified to , which suggests that all slip emissions are considered to be methane ( 1 100 𝐶 𝑠𝑙𝑖𝑝 𝑗 × 𝐺𝑊𝑃 𝐶𝐻 4 ) only.

It  should  be noted that, according to FuelEU Article 10(5), shipping companies can diverge from default values for CH 4 and N2O by using actual values certified by laboratory testing or direct  emission measurements. However, FuelEU Article 10(6) mandates an implementing act  to  specify  which  international  standards  and  certification  references  are  accepted  for demonstrating actual tank-to-wake emission factors. The IMO is currently developing such standards, which are expected to be referenced in FuelEU only after their completion. Until then, only default factors can be used.

Apart  from  the  mass of fuel, the wind-assisted propulsion reward factors, RFNBO reward factors,  and  the  electricity  delivered,  values  for  the  elements  in  the  above  formulas  are included  in  the  table  in  FuelEU  Annex  II  for  various  fuel  classes  and  pathways.  These additional elements are covered in Chapter 2.

13 EU ETS and MRV guidance document no.1 states that where default slippage coefficients are not listed for a specific emission source class, companies should apply a slippage coefficient of zero  https://www.emsa.europa.eu/faq-monitoring-plan.html. However, future revisions of the regulation could include slippage for other gases.

The different Fuel Classes in Column 1 are Fossil, Biofuels, RFNBO/e-Fuels, and Others 14 . Since these fuel classes have different calculation methods for the WtT GHG emission factor (i.e., ), they are considered individually in this Chapter. 𝐶𝑂 2𝑒𝑞 𝑊𝑡𝑇

Certain  TtW  emission  factors  are  still  under  development  and  some  cells  in the table of Annex II indicate 'To Be Measured (TBM)' or 'Not Available (N/A)'.

Where a cell indicates either TBM or N/A, unless a value is demonstrated in accordance with  Article  10,  the  highest  default  value  of  the  fuel  class  in  the  same  column  shall  be used.

For all cells containing 'TBM' or 'N/A' in the table found in Annex II, the highest default value in the fuel class is assigned and bolded in the tables within this guidance document.

Deviating from FuelEU Annex II, note that ethane as a marine fuel in use has been added in the fossil fuel sections of this guidance document, while Annex II bio-H2, e-LPG, and e-DME pathways are left out in this guidance document, due to the current lack of necessary default values.

## 1.2.2. Fossil fuels

To calculate WtW emission intensities for fossil fuels, the relevant values from the table in FuelEU Annex II should be used.

The relevant values for WtW emission intensity calculation purposes are shown in Table 2.

14 The Fuel Class 'Others' concerns the energy from electricity from on-shore power supply (OPS), elaborated on in Chapter 3. Note that Recycled Carbon Fuels (RCFs) (e.g. pyrolysis oil) and other synthetic low-carbon fuels (e.g. 'blue ammonia') are not included in Annex II of FuelEU and this guidance document.

Note on Ethane: While ethane is not found in Annex II, it has been included as a marine fuel  in  use.  It  is  recommended  in the ETS/MRV General Guidance 1 16 to use the default TtW emission factor of 2.927 tCO2/t fuel from resolution MEPC.364(79) EEDI Guidelines. 17 All other values shown are in-line with the approach outlined in FuelEU Article 10.2, which requires use of the least favorable fossil fuel pathway for fuels not covered. We aligned its WtT with LNG and non-CO ₂ emission factors with HFO, assuming least favorable fossil values. This approach ensures consistency with FuelEU and relevant guidance until more specific data becomes available.

15 Ethane is not included in Annex II and therefore the values in the grey shaded row represent suggested values for the pathway. See note on ethane.

The following section provides a detailed breakdown of how the WtW emission intensity of a particular fossil fuel pathway is derived, using HFO (Grade RME to RMK) as an example.

As stated in FuelEU Annex I:

The WtT GHG emission factors (CO2eqWtT,i) default values are contained in Annex II. In the case of fossil fuels, only the default values contained in Annex II shall be used.

For  example,  as  shown  in  Table X, the CO 2 eqWtT ,i is  13.5  gCO2eq/MJ. (See also FuelEU Annex II column 4).

Applying  the WtT GHG intensity formula (Equation 1), using 1 metric tonne for illustrative purposes:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

In  the  same way, using the relevant values from the table in FuelEU Annex II, recalling the TtW  formula,  and  given  Equation  (2)  and  the  corresponding  GWP100  values,  the  TtW emission intensity of consumed HFO is calculated as follows:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Recalling Equation (1), the total WtW emission intensity of HFO is the sum of the calculated WtT and TtW emission intensities:

= 91.74420 gCO2eq/MJ 𝑊𝑡𝑊 𝐺𝐻𝐺 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦  =  13. 5 𝑔𝐶𝑂 2 𝑒𝑞/𝑀𝐽 +  78. 24420 𝑔𝐶𝑂 2 𝑒𝑞/𝑀𝐽

Applying the applicable GHG intensity formula from Annex I (Equation 1) and including the values from Table 2 (FuelEU Annex II), the resulting WtW GHG intensity per unit of energy of different fossil fuels types is as shown in Table 3.

## 1.2.3. Biofuels (liquid and gaseous)

For RED certified liquid and gaseous biofuels, the WtT GHG emission intensity (CO2eqWtT) for each fuel consumer is to be calculated as per column 4 of the table in FuelEU Annex II, as follows:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where E = Total GHG emission intensity (gCO2eq/MJ) from the supply and use of the fuel, as per the Proof of Sustainability (PoS) or Proof of Compliance (PoC) 19 of the certified biofuel. Without a PoS/PoC, or where the biofuel does not meet the sustainability criteria 20  and GHG emissions savings criteria 21 ,  or  that  are  produced  from  food  and  feed  crops,  referred to in FuelEU  Article 10(1)(a), the emission factors (WtT and TtW) of the least favourable fossil fuel pathway for the type of fuel in question should be used.

In Table 4, default values for E are used 22 to calculate the WtT emission intensities in column 4 accordingly. If the actual E value from the PoS / PoC differs from the default value, the value from the PoS/PoC should be used to calculate the actual WtT emission intensity of the biofuel pathway.

18 Ethane is not included in Annex II and therefore the values in the grey shaded row represent suggested values for the pathway. See note on ethane.

Note on biomethane E values: The default upstream emissions (E value) for biomethane used in the FuelEU Maritime context are taken from RED II Annex VI D, using the value of 14 gCO ₂ e/MJ for biowaste-derived biomethane with closed digestate storage and off-gas combustion.  This  illustrative  value  provides  an  example of emissions up to the point of injection into the natural gas grid. However, it does not include emissions from liquefaction or bunkering, which are necessary to deliver biomethane to ships as a marine fuel and are counted in the TtW emissions.

To  provide  an  example  value  for  these  additional  emissions  we  use  methodologies outlined in ISCC 205 (v4.1, January 2024). 23  The guideline under the ISCC EU scheme, includes a method known as 'liquefaction by equivalence' for estimating emissions when terminal-specific data is not available.

## Liquefaction Emissions: Methodology and Calculation

ISCC  205  Section  4.3.5  allows  operators  to  calculate  liquefaction  emissions  using  a benchmark method that reflects average EU  conditions. Based  on  this  method, liquefaction emissions are estimated as follows:

- Electricity use for liquefaction : 0.06048 MJ electricity (LV or low voltage) per MJ fuel, is converted to kWh: . 0. 06048 𝑀𝐽 𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦, 𝐿𝑉 /𝑀𝐽 𝑓𝑢𝑒𝑙 × 1𝑘𝑊ℎ/ 3. 6 𝑀𝐽 𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦 =  0. 0168  𝑘𝑊ℎ/𝑀𝐽 𝑓𝑢𝑒𝑙
- GHG intensity of electricity : 24  EU27 low-voltage average = 308 gCO ₂ e/kWh
- Resulting liquefaction emissions : 0. 0168 × 308  =  5. 17 𝑔𝐶𝑂₂𝑒/𝑀𝐽 𝑏𝑖𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑒
- Adjustment for ISCC 'conversion losses' : ISCC 205 recommends applying a Feedstock Factor (FF) of 1.00013 to account for a 0.013% conversion loss, which has a negligible numerical impact but aligns with ISCC/RED methodology.

Therefore, the upstream emissions values used in our calculations, including the RED II Annex VI D value (14 gCO2eq/MJ) plus liquefaction are:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

These liquefaction emissions are an illustrative example based on ISCC 205 Guidance. However,  where  actual data is available, operators can potentially  achieve  lower emissions  factors  depending  on  the  liquefaction  technology and location. Here are two examples:

- Recondenser-based  liquefaction is  the  standard  technology  at  LNG  terminals, using boil-off gas to liquefy biomethane efficiently. It typically consumes ~200 kWh per tonne of biomethane, 25  resulting in an estimated CI of ~1.23 gCO ₂ e/MJ using EU low voltage grid data (see figure in previous calculation). Actual values vary by terminal and operating conditions.

23  ISCC 205 is the guidance document titled "Greenhouse Gas Emissions", which outlines methodologies for calculating life-cycle emissions, including options for liquefaction by equivalence and bunkering emissions. The latest version (v4.1, January 2024) is available at:

https://www.iscc-system.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ISCC\_EU\_205\_Greenhouse-Gas-Emissions\_v4.1\_January2024.pdf

24 The GHG emissions from electricity in the EU of 308 gCO2e/kWh is from IR (EU) 2022/996: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg\_impl/2022/996/oj/eng. We use EU-wide GHG emissions to provide an example value. To select the country/location where the liquifaction will take place, see the respective Low Voltage GHG intensity from the Publications Office: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32022R0996

This document has not

- Reliquefaction systems use external refrigeration and are typically found at peak shaving or low-send-out terminals. They  are less efficient, with emissions depending  on  design  and  scale.  No  default  CI  exists,  so  site-specific  data  or conservative estimates should be used.

Operators are encouraged to gather terminal-specific electricity consumption data or apply 'equivalence'  with  ISCC  auditor  approval,  as  required  under  ISCC  EU  certification schemes.

## Bunkering Emissions (not included above)

Emissions from bio-LNG bunkering are also relevant and should be reported under Etd (emissions from transport and distribution). These vary with bunker vessel type, fuel used, and  round-trip  distance.  ISCC  205  provides  useful  guidance  on  how  to calculate such emissions (but does not provide relevant emissions). A value for bunkering is not included in  the  19.17  gCO ₂ e/MJ value above but the bunkering emissions would be included in a PoS and should be considered in full well-to-wake calculations.

For  LCV,  the  main reference in FuelEU Annex II table (see column 3) is the default LCV values  in  RED  Annex  III.  In  Table  4,  the  RED  Annex  III  default  LCV  values  are  used (converted  to  MJ/g).  When biofuel production pathways do not have default LCVs as per legal reference, the LCV or information to derive the LCV from the PoS/PoC provided by the fuel supplier should be based on a lab analysis.

Including additional fuel pathways and fuel consumers, the relevant values for WtW emission intensity calculation purposes are shown in Table 4.

For the calculation of the GHG intensity of the energy used on board by a ship, from 1 January 2025 to 31 December 2033 a multiplier of '2' can be used to reward the ship for the use of RFNBO. The methodology for this calculation is set out in Annex I .

The methodology for calculating the GHG intensity of energy used on board, which includes the  RFNBO  multiplier,  is  specified  in  Annex  I  of  FuelEU.  The  calculation  of  WtW  GHG intensity  with  the  multiplier  or  'reward  factor'  is  illustrated  below.  The impact on a vessel's compliance  balance  can  be  found  in  Examples  4  and  6  provided  in  Section  1.4  of  this document.

For  RFNBOs,  the  WtT emissions (CO2eqWtT) in  column 4 of the table in FuelEU Annex II refer to RED. The relevant supplementing Delegated Regulation 31  stipulates that the certified E value (from the PoS/PoC) determines the GHG emissions for RFNBOs. To calculate the WtT emissions from RFNBOs or e-fuels, the emissions from the fuel in use (eu) include all combustion  emissions  and  should  be  deducted.  This  aims  to  avoid  double  counting  of emissions under FuelEU where the TtW emissions are added separately. A deduction of the CO2 emission as done for biofuels, is not needed.

For RFNBOs, the FuelEU WtT emissions (CO2eqWtT) are calculated as: , 𝐶𝑂 2 𝑒𝑞 𝑊𝑡𝑇 =  𝐸  - 𝑒 𝑢 where E = Total GHG emission intensity (g CO2eq/MJ) from the supply and use of the fuel, as  per  the  Proof  of  Sustainability  (PoS)  or  Proof  of  Compliance  (PoC) 32 of  the  certified biofuel. The value is the emissions from the combusted fuel in use, as per the PoS/PoC. 𝑒 𝑢

In  Table  6, E values  for  RFNBOs we use the arbitrary value of 10 g CO 2 eq/MJ to illustrate the calculation of WtT emission intensities in column 4 accordingly. This is an example value only. In practice, E should be taken from a PoS or PoC, demonstrating compliance with EU certification requirements.

Note on RFNBO E Value: For illustrative purposes, we have selected an E value of 10 g CO2eq/MJ. This value falls within the allowed range up to 28.2 g CO2eq/MJ according to the RED Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/1185, which requires a minimum reduction of 70%  in  GHG  emissions  compared  to  the  comparator  baseline  of  94  gCO 2 eq/MJ.  The chosen value of 10 g CO2eq/MJ is arbitrary and chosen to avoid representing any specific RFNBO pathway, while providing a credible example.

The values  in  Table  6  stem  from  the  standard values provided in Delegated Regulation 𝑒 𝑢 (EU)  2023/1185.   If  the  actual E value  and value  from  the  PoS  /  PoC  differ  from  the 𝑒 𝑢 assumed and standard values, the values from the PoS/PoC should be used to calculate the actual WtT emission intensity of the RFNBO pathway.

The relevant values for WtW emission intensity calculation purposes are shown in Table 6.

For example, for e-diesel, given the indicated E value of 10.00 gCO2eq/MJ and standard 𝑒 𝑢 value of 73.20 gCO2eq/MJ, the WtT GHG emission factor (CO2eqWtT,i) is calculated as:

The  WtT  GHG  intensity of e-diesel, including the RFNBO reward factor and for simplicity using 1 metric tonne, calculates as follows:

Similarly, the RFNBO reward factor is also part of the TtW emission intensity formula, which gives a TtW emission intensity of consumed e-diesel as:

The  total  WtW  emission  intensity  of  e-diesel  is  the  sum  of  the  calculated  WtT  and  TtW emission intensities:

Note that the RFNBO reward factor (RWD) or multiplier, which is set at 2 in the FuelEU, has the overall effect of halving the WtW GHG emission intensity of the RFNBO.

Applying the applicable GHG intensity formula from FuelEU Annex I in the same manner and including the values from Table 7 (FuelEU Annex II), the resulting WtW GHG intensity for RFNBO type fuels, with and without applying the RFNBO reward factor, are shown in Table 7.

As  a  reminder,  WtT  emission  intensities  in  Table  7  are  calculated  based  on  assumed indicative  emission intensity values. For actual WtT emission intensities calculations of the various  RFNBO  pathways  ( ),  the  actual  respective  emission  intensities  ( and 𝐸  - 𝑒 𝑢 𝐸 𝑒 𝑢 values)  from  the  PoS/PoC  of the RFNBO should be used to calculate the WtW emission intensities of RFNBOs.

## 1.3. Compliance Balance: Step-by-Step Guidance

## 1.3.1. Overview of the compliance balance formula

The next step in the FuelEU calculations is the 'compliance balance' formula as provided in FuelEU Annex IV. The compliance balance is defined in FuelEU Article 3(35):

' compliance  balance'  means  the  measure  of  a  ship's  over-  or  under-compliance  with regard to the limits for the yearly average GHG intensity of the energy used on board by a ship or the RFNBO subtarget, which is calculated in accordance with Part A of Annex IV

The  compliance  balance  calculations  determine  a  ship's  positive  compliance  due  to over-achievement  of  the  annual  target  (i.e.,  compliance  surplus),  or  negative  compliance balance  from  under-achievement  of  the  annual  target  (i.e.,  compliance  deficit).  At  the discretion of the company, 34 ships can choose to participate in flexibility mechanisms defined in Articles 20 and  21, such  as  banking  surplus  compliance,  borrowing  from  future compliance  balance,  and  pooling  of  surplus  compliance  (see  Chapter  4). Ships failing to meet annual targets are subject to a financial penalty. To translate this into practical terms, the following section describes the compliance balance formula and penalty, showing how to determine whether a ship has met, exceeded, or fallen short of the annual GHG intensity target.

34 'Company' is the entity responsible for the operation of the ship according to definition FuelEU Article 3(13).

As specified in the FuelEU Annex IV Part A, the formula for calculating a ship's compliance balance is given as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

## Variable and subscript definitions per Annex I and IV

- :  Carbon  dioxide  equivalent,  is  a  measure  typically  expressed  in  grams  or 𝐶𝑂₂𝑒 tonnes and is used to compare the emissions of various greenhouse gases based on their global warming potential. It provides a way of expressing the impact of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) gas in terms of the amount of CO ₂ that would create the same amount of warming.
- : This is the GHG intensity limit for the energy used on board the ship in a 𝐺𝐻𝐺𝐼𝐸 𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡 given Reporting Period, as stipulated by Article 4(2) of FuelEU.
- :  This  represents  the  yearly  average  of  the  GHG intensity of the energy 𝐺𝐻𝐺𝐼𝐸 𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑎𝑙 used on board, calculated for the relevant Reporting Period based on Annex I (see 1.2.1).
- : Index corresponding to the fuel types delivered to the ship in the Reporting Period. 𝑖
- : Mass of fuel type i, consumed by the ship in terms of grams of fuel. 𝑀 𝑖
- :  Lower  calorific  value  of  fuel  type  i  in  terms  of  megajoules  per  gram  of  fuel 𝐿𝐶𝑉 𝑖 (MJ/gFuel), which measures the amount of heat released by burning one gram of the fuel.
- : Energy in the form of electricity delivered to the ship through an OPS connection 𝐸 𝑘 point k in terms of MJ.
- : Index corresponding to the OPS connection points. 𝑘

The compliance balance formula calculates the difference between the annual target from ( ) and reported GHG intensity ( ), scaled by the sum of total energy 𝐺𝐻𝐺𝐼𝐸 𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡 𝐺𝐻𝐺𝐼𝐸 𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑎𝑙 consumption from fuels and shore-side electricity within the scope of the FuelEU. A positive result indicates surplus compliance, while a negative result signals a compliance deficit.

## 1.3.3. Penalty formula breakdown (Annex IV Part B)

As specified in the FuelEU Annex IV Part B, the formula for calculating a ship's penalty is given as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

## Explanations of constants in the formula:

- :  This  constant,  expressed  in  megajoules  per  tonne  (MJ/tfuel), 41, 000 𝑀𝐽/𝑡𝑓𝑢𝑒𝑙 represents the LCV of Very Low Sulphur Fuel Oil (VLSFO) which is used to convert

the compliance balance and GHGIEactual into a VLSFO equivalent emissions deficit in tonnes.

- :  This  is  the  penalty  rate  applied  per  metric  tonne  of  VLSFO 2, 400 𝐸𝑈𝑅/𝑡𝑓𝑢𝑒𝑙 equivalent emissions deficit.

The penalty calculation starts by taking the absolute compliance deficit on a weighted energy basis,  indicating  the  total  emission  deficit.  This  is  then  divided  by  the attained GHGIE actual , which is converted to an emission intensity per ton of VLSFO equivalent by multiplying with the constant LCV of 41,000 MJ/t. The result is a VLSFO equivalent deficit in tonnes. The final  step  in  the  penalty  calculation  process  involves  multiplying  the  VLSFO  equivalent emissions by the penalty rate of 2,400 EUR to determine the total financial penalty.

Note  on  the  Penalty  Calculation :  The  fixed  penalty  rate  of  €2,400  per  metric  tonne applies to a VLSFOequivalent compliance deficit . It applies to the amount of energy that is in  deficit  relative  to  the  respective  FuelEU  GHG  intensity target , expressed in VLSFO equivalent  tonnes.  A  vessel  is  therefore  not  directly  penalised  for  burning  e.g.,  HFO  or LFO, but rather penalized to the extent it fails to reach the respective GHG target in that particular year, resulting in an energy weighted compliance deficit.

## Penalty calculation for two or more consecutive Reporting Periods

Ships with recurring compliance deficits in consecutive years will incur an additional charge. The total penalty for each subsequent year increases by an additional 10% annually. The additional charge stated in Article 23(2) can be expressed as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

- n : The number of consecutive non-compliant Reporting Periods.

For example, if a ship has a compliance deficit for three consecutive Reporting Periods, in the  Verification  Period  following  the  third  year,  the  calculation  of  the  total  penalty  would include an additional charge of 20%. The equation above with is as follows: 𝑛 = 3

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

If the penalty calculated in the third year is €5,000, the total penalty would be:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

In this example, the ship will have to pay a penalty of €6,000 in addition to previous penalties owed. Non-compliance with penalty payments can lead to enforcement actions as specified under Article 23.

The penalty does not increase in case the ship has a Reporting Period where it did not have any voyages in scope of the regulation (year Y) and in year Y-1 and year Y+1 was subject to penalties,  since  such  scenario  does  not  fulfill  the  'consecutive'  condition.  In  addition,  the penalty  does  not  increase  in  case  of  shipping  company changes, since represents the 𝑛

## 1.3.4. Step-by-step guidance

The following steps provide suggested best practice for how to calculate the compliance balance using the formulas provided in FuelEU.

## Step 1: Determine GHG Intensity Target

The first step is to identify the as per the specifications in Article 4(2). The 𝐺𝐻𝐺𝐼𝐸 𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡 FuelEU establishes limits to the yearly average GHG Intensity of the energy used on board a ship, following a reference value and reduction targets.

In  accordance with Article 4(2), the GHG Intensity reference value is 91.16 /MJ. The 𝑔𝐶𝑂₂𝑒 reduction and timeline is illustrated in Table 8. 𝐺𝐻𝐺𝐼𝐸 𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡

Table 8. FuelEU GHG intensity limit on energy used on board by a ship

| Timeline            | Reduction Percentage   | GHGIE target      |
|---------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| From 1 January 2025 | -2%                    | 89.33680 𝑔𝐶𝑂₂𝑒/𝑀𝐽 |
| From 1 January 2030 | -6%                    | 85.69040 𝑔𝐶𝑂₂𝑒/𝑀𝐽 |
| From 1 January 2035 | -14.5%                 | 77.94180 𝑔𝐶𝑂₂𝑒/𝑀𝐽 |
| From 1 January 2040 | -31%                   | 62.90040 𝑔𝐶𝑂₂𝑒/𝑀𝐽 |
| From 1 January 2045 | -62%                   | 34.64080 𝑔𝐶𝑂₂𝑒/𝑀𝐽 |
| From 1 January 2050 | -80%                   | 18.23200 𝑔𝐶𝑂₂𝑒/𝑀𝐽 |

## Step 2: Calculate the Total Energy Consumption

The next step is to calculate the total fuel consumed during the Reporting Period on voyages and port stays within the scope of the regulation. This requires summing the mass of each type of fuel used, applying the following formula:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Where represents the mass of each fuel type and its corresponding lower calorific 𝑀 𝑖 𝐿𝐶𝑉 𝑖 value.  Each fuel's mass is multiplied by its calorific value to convert mass to energy. The total energy from all fuels is then aggregated.

This document has not

If electricity was delivered via OPS during the Reporting Period in port stays within scope of the regulation, it should be included using the following formula:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where represents the electricity  in  megajoules  delivered  through  each OPS connection 𝐸 𝑘 point .  The  sum  of  energy  from  both  fuel  and  electricity  provides  the  total  energy 𝑘 consumption in megajoules (MJ) needed for the compliance balance calculation.

In case vessels performed voyages covered by the exemptions provided by FuelEU Articles 2(3),  2(4),  2(5),  and  2(6)  related  to  voyages  between  EEA  Member States and non-EEA Member States or voyages to Outermost Region ports, energy calculated for the respective legs  should  be  reduced.  In  addition,  deduction  relating  to  sailing  in  ice  conditions  or  the technical characteristics of ice class ships is to be taken into consideration. Refer to Chapter 2  on  Extra-EEA  Voyages  and  Chapter  3  on  Technology-Specific  Calculations  for  more information.

## Step 3: Calculate the GHG Intensity Actual

The next step is to calculate the according to Annex I and described in Section 𝐺𝐻𝐺𝐼𝐸 𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑎𝑙 1.2.  When calculating the for the compliance balance, the intensity of all fuel(s) 𝐺𝐻𝐺𝐼𝐸 𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑎𝑙 and energy used onboard falling under the FuelEU scope throughout the Reporting Period should be taken into account. This calculation effectively produces a weighted average of the GHG intensity for all fuels used, adjusted for the energy content of each fuel type used. The  formula  is  also  impacted  by  the  use  of  RFNBOs,  ice  navigation,  and  the  use  of wind-assisted  propulsion  (see  Chapter  3).  The  application  of an RFNBO reward factor is covered in Section 1.4  Examples 4 and 6.

## Step 4: Compute the Compliance Balance

The  compliance  balance  equation  provides  the  difference  between  the  target  and  actual GHG  intensities ,  multiplied  by  the  total  energy  consumption (𝐺𝐻𝐺𝐼𝐸 𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡 - 𝐺𝐻𝐺𝐼𝐸 𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑎𝑙 ) . The  result  is  the  net  compliance  balance  in  grams  of  CO2 [ 𝑖 𝑛𝑓𝑢𝑒𝑙 ∑ 𝑀 𝑖 × 𝐿𝐶𝑉 𝑖 + 𝑘 𝑐 ∑𝐸 𝑘 ] equivalent. A positive balance indicates that the ship is performing better than the target and therefore generating a surplus. A negative balance indicates  under-compliance  and therefore has a deficit.

## 1.3.5. Rounding rules

In  the  absence  of  established  rounding  rules  for  FuelEU  at  the  time  of  publication,  it  is recommended  using  the rounding conventions used in the EU Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) system, THETIS-MRV 35 , which is used to collect and manage data under

This document has not

the  EU  MRV  Regulation  (EU)  2015/757.  Alignment  with  MRV  conventions  minimizes calculation discrepancies between regulatory frameworks.

In alignment with MRV, it is proposed to round to five decimal places for all values involved in  the  calculations.  It  should  be  avoided  to  round  intermediate  results  to  avoid  deviations. The only exception is in the penalty calculation, where the final penalty amount should be rounded to the nearest integer.

Note on rounding to tonnes: In practice companies may choose to estimate their compliance balance in units of tonnes CO2 eq. When doing the actual calculation this should be avoided.

For example, if you convert the following compliance balance to tonnes of CO 2 eq:

- 1, 255, 610, 552. 4  ÷   10 6 =  1, 255 𝑡𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑠 𝐶𝑂 2 𝑒𝑞

and convert back to grams CO2eq you get the following compliance balance:

- 1, 255  ×  10 6 =   - 1, 255, 000, 000 𝑔 𝐶𝑂 2 𝑒𝑞

This leads to a different result in the penalty calculation.

## 1.4. Compliance Balance Calculation Examples

This  section  provides a series of compliance balance calculation examples that apply the methodology for various fuels and energy combinations with consistent energy consumption.

Example  1  establishes  a  baseline  scenario,  which  is  then  used  for  comparison  in  all subsequent cases. For combinations involving multiple fuel types, we assume blending for biofuels and dual-fuel engines for RFNBOs. Each example begins by setting an illustrative amount of non-fossil fuel, with the fossil fuel quantity adjusted to ensure total energy use is aligned with the baseline.

In  all  examples,  table  cells  highlighted  in  yellow  require  user  input,  whereas  white  cells contain fixed values established by legislation or are calculations based on given formulas.

## Example 1: Fossil HFO and MDO (Intra-EEA)

In the first example, we calculate the compliance balance for a  vessel  operating on EEA to EEA voyages or within EEA ports,  consuming 12,000 tonnes of HFO in the main engine and 1,400 tonnes of MDO in auxiliary engines. As both fuels are fossil fuels, default emission values are all taken from the FuelEU Annex II.

## Example 2: Fossil LNG with two engine types (Intra-EEA)

In the second example, a vessel utilizes LNG as the primary fuel source.  The  main  engine,  a  LNG  dual-fuel  Otto  cycle  (low pressure  4-stroke)  designed  for  slow-speed  operations,  uses LNG as well as MDO as a pilot fuel to facilitate combustion. In addition  to  the  main  engine,  the  vessel  is  equipped  with  LNG

auxiliary  engines,  which  are  assumed to operate at medium speed. This results in varying GHG  emission  factors  for  the  different  engines.  The  auxiliary's  consumption  of  LNG  is intended to substitute approximately 1,000 tonnes of MDO, illustrating a common practice in dual-fuel LNG vessels.

## Example 4: Fossil HFO and RFNBO e-NH3 (Intra-EEA)

This example shows a dual-fuel ammonia vessel that is primarily using  HFO  and  MDO,  and  has  bunkered  400  tonnes  of ammonia produced from renewable electricity, or eNH3. In this example, we assume the eNH3 is certified as an RFNBO and is therefore able to apply the RFNBO multiplier, i.e., RWD = 2.

## Example 5: Fossil LNG and biomethane (Intra-EEA)

In  this  example,  we  show  a  vessel  navigating  between  EEA ports,  utilizing  LNG  as the primary fuel source and bunkering a small amount of liquified biomethane. The main engine, a LNG dual-fuel Otto cycle (low pressure 4-stroke) designed  for medium-speed  operations,  is  using  three  fuels:  fossil  LNG,

liquified  biomethane, as well as MDO as a pilot fuel to facilitate combustion. MDO is also used in auxiliary engines.

## Example 6: Fossil HFO and two different WtT footprints of e-MeOH (Intra-EEA)

This  example  shows  a  vessel that is primarily using HFO and bunkers  e-methanol  (e-MeOH)  with  different  emission  factors due to different WtT GHG emission values reported on the PoS. Both are eligible for RFNBO rewards, i.e., RWD = 2.

Building  on  the  foundational  principles  for  calculating  GHG  intensity  and  the  compliance balance  in  this  chapter,  Chapter  2  addresses  how  these  same  calculation  principles  are applied to ships operating between EEA ports and non-EEA ports and Outermost Regions. This includes how to implement exemptions and allocation of fuels to compliance balance calculations.

## 2. Chapter 2: Extra-EEA Voyages

## 2.1. Introduction and Key Concepts

The  following  section  provides  guidance  for  applying  the  calculation  methodologies  from Chapter  1  to  voyages  between  European  Economic  Area  (EEA)  Member  States  and non-EEA Member States within the scope of FuelEU, known as 'Extra-EEA' voyages. The section is  complemented  by  additional  guidance  for  technology-specific  conditions  in Chapter 3.

In  both  the  MRV  Maritime  Regulation  and  FuelEU,  a  voyage is considered from the last berth or ship-to-ship transfer within a port of call 37 to the first berth or ship-to-ship transfer in the following port of call.

Furthermore,  EU  regulations  also  refer  to  Extra-EEA  as  'International  Voyages'.  This  is defined as a voyage by sea from a port in a Member State to a port outside that Member State,  and  vice  versa.  Conversely,  a  'domestic  voyage' is a sea voyage from a port in a Member State to the same or another port within that Member State. 38

While voyages between EEA Member States (hereafter 'Intra-EEA Voyages') are in principle international voyages,  from  a  FuelEU  perspective,  these  are  treated  differently  from international voyages between EEA  Member  States and third countries (hereafter 'Extra-EEA').  This  distinction  is  important  for  calculation  and  compliance  purposes,  as  it defines the scope of energy falling under the FuelEU, as described in Article 2(1) of FuelEU:

This  Regulation  applies  to  all  ships  of  above  5  000  gross  tonnage  that serve  the  purpose  of  transporting  passengers  or  cargo  for  commercial purposes, regardless of their flag, in respect of:

- (a)   the energy used during their stay within a port of call under the jurisdiction of a Member State;
- (b) the  entirety  of  the  energy  used  on  voyages  from  a  port  of  call under the jurisdiction of a Member State to a port of call under the jurisdiction of a Member State;
- (c)    notwithstanding point (b), one half of the energy used on voyages arriving at or departing from a port of call located in an outermost region under the jurisdiction of a Member State; and
- (d)   one half of the energy used on voyages arriving at or departing from a port of call under the jurisdiction of a Member State, where the previous or the next port of call is under the jurisdiction of a third country.'

The  FuelEU  is  relevant  to  the  EEA,  meaning  that  once  incorporated  into  the  EEA Agreement, it will apply to EU Member States as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway

37 FuelEU defines 'port of call' as the port where a ship stops to load or unload cargo or to embark or disembark passengers. Regulation (EU) 2023/1805 Article 3, 'Definitions.'

(except Svalbard). 39   In that case,ports of those countries should be understood as Member State ports. Pending incorporation of the FuelEU into the EEA Agreement, Norwegian and Icelandic ports should be treated as third-country (non-Member State) ports.

In  addition,  ports  in Overseas Countries and Territories ('OCT') of the European Union do not qualify as ports of call under the jurisdiction of a Member State. 40 Additionally the Faroe Islands (Denmark) and Svalbard (Norway) are excluded. Practically, this means that voyages  between  a  port  of  call  in  the  excluded  territories  listed  above  and  a  port  of  call under the jurisdiction of an EEA State constitute as "incoming" or "outgoing" voyages and should be monitored and reported.

For regulatory clarity,  we can identify four main FuelEU application scenarios , excluding the various exemptions to FuelEU, that will be discussed in more detail in this chapter.

- Within port of call: Refers  to  the  energy  used  while  the  ship  is at berth 41  and the energy used within ports when the ship is not at berth (e.g., moving within a port of call between two voyages).
- Intra-EEA Voyages: The  Regulation applies to ships for the entirety of the energy used on voyages between ports under the jurisdiction of EU/EEA Member States.
- Voyages to or from Outermost Regions (OMRs): OMRs are regions that, although geographically  distant  from  continental  Europe,  are  part  of  the  EU,  including  the Azores,  Canary  Islands,  and  French  Guiana.  For  voyages  that  start  or  end in an OMR under the jurisdiction of an EU Member State, the Regulation applies to ships for one half of the energy used. 42
- Extra-EEA  Voyages: For  voyages  between  a  port  under  the  jurisdiction  of  an EU/EEA  Member State and a port under the jurisdiction of a third country (or vice versa), the Regulation applies to ships for one half of the energy used.

Certain stops do not qualify as ports of call under FuelEU as stated in definition in Article 3(10), these are:

- Stops  for  the  sole  purposes  of  refuelling;  obtaining  supplies  (including  fodder  for vessels  transporting  animals  as  cargo);  relieving  the  crew;  going  into  dry-dock  or making repairs to the ship and/or its equipment;
- Stops in port because the ship is in need of assistance or in distress;
- Ship to ship transfers carried out outside ports;
- Stops  for  the  sole  purpose  of  taking  shelter  from  adverse  weather  or  rendered necessary by search and rescue activities;
- Stops  of  containerships in a neighbouring container transhipment port listed in the implementing act adopted pursuant to Article 2(2) of the FuelEU.

The fact that the above stops are excluded from the definition of 'port of call' does not mean that the relevant energy falls out of scope, because whether the energy will fall within scope

42 Unless specifically excluded by Member State, for more information see section 2.2.4. 41 As per Article 3 of the MRV Maritime Regulation, a ship is to be considered at berth when 'securely moored or anchored in a port falling under the jurisdiction of a Member State while it is loading, unloading or hoteling, including the time spent when not engaged in cargo operations'. The ship will also be considered as 'at berth' when engaging in any operation other than cargo handling within port (e.g. bunkering, positioning, inspections, etc.) between arrival at first berth and departure from last berth as long as the ship is securely moored or anchored within port limits.

will  ultimately  depend  on  the  previous  and  the  next  stop  and more specifically on whether one of these two stops is a port of call within FuelEU. 43

The  same  applies  where  multiple  stops  excluded  from  the  definition  of  'port  of  call'  are carried out one after the other.

## 2.2. Special Voyage Scenarios

This section outlines specific voyage scenarios requiring special considerations in terms of the FuelEU calculations.

## 2.2.1. Exemptions for outermost region - Article 2(1)

## Regulatory reference

Article  2(1)(c)  of  FuelEU  applies  to  all  ships  of  above  5,000  gross  tonnage  that  transport passengers or cargo for commercial purposes, regardless of their flag. This applies to one half of the energy used on voyages arriving at or departing from a port of call located in an outermost region under the jurisdiction of a Member State.

## Introduction

Due to the special characteristics and constraints of the OMRs of the Union, particularly their remoteness  and  insularity,  special  consideration  is  given  to  maintaining  their  accessibility and efficient connectivity by maritime transport.

Two types of voyages related to OMR ports are exempted from the scope of FuelEU. These exemptions will affect the reporting of energy used on board, GHG intensity calculation, and the  compliance  strategies  of  relevant  ships.  This  section  focuses  on  the  permanent exemption  for  OMRs,  while  the  following  section  covers  the  temporary  exemptions  for specific OMR routes and ports as outlined in Article 2(4).

## Definition of Outermost Regions

The EU includes nine OMRs, defined as territories in Article 349 TFEU 44 .

As  explained  in  Chapter  2 of the EU ETS and MRV guidance document no.1 45 , the term 'ports of call under the jurisdiction of a Member State' refers to ports located in EU territory where EU law fully applies. Not all ports belonging to a Member State are considered EU territories  (see  list below). For a voyage to be covered by the MRV Maritime Regulation, at least one port of call should be located in an EU territory.

## Energy scope falling under FuelEU

Only half of the energy used on voyages 'departing from' or 'arriving at' a port of call in an OMR should be included in the scope of this Regulation, as per Article 2(1)(c). This is due to the  unique  characteristics  and  constraints  of  the  OMRs  in  the  Union,  particularly  their remoteness and insularity. Special consideration is given to preserving their accessibility and efficient connectivity by maritime transport.

For the same reasons, there may be temporary exemptions for specific OMRs routes and ports, as per Article 2(4). This will be discussed in Chapter 2.2.4.

Possible voyage combinations involving at least one end of port call involved in a OMR can be divided into two main categories:

## 1.       Extra-EU voyages between

- an OMR port and a non-EEA port

## 2.       Intra-EU voyages between

- An OMR port and an EEA-port in the same EEA Member State
- An OMR port and an EEA-port in a different EEA Member State
- Two ports within the same OMR
- Two OMR ports of the same EEA Member State
- Two OMR ports of different EEA Member States

For  Extra-EEA  voyages,  50% of the energy used should be included in the scope of this Regulation, as per Article 2(1)(d). This also applies to voyages between an OMR port and a non-EEA port:

Article  2(1)(d):  one  half  of  the  energy  used  on  voyages  arriving  at  or departing from a port of call under the jurisdiction of a Member State, where the previous or the next port of call is under the jurisdiction of a third country.

For Intra-EEA voyages, 100% of the energy used should be included in the scope of this Regulation, as per Article 2(1)(b).

This document has not

Article  2(1)(b):  the  entirety of the energy used on voyages from a port of call under the jurisdiction of a Member State to a port of call under the jurisdiction of a Member State;

However, Article 2(1)(c) provides specific rules to voyages 'departing from' or 'arriving at' an OMR port and supersedes Article 2(1)(b). Only 50% of the energy used in these voyages is included in the scope of this Regulation.

Article  2(1)(c): notwithstanding  point  (b) ,  one  half  of  the  energy  used  on  voyages arriving  at  or  departing  from  a  port  of  call  located  in  an  outermost  region  under  the jurisdiction of a Member State;

This means that a voyage between an OMR port and a Member State port falls under Article 2(1)(c),  despite  being  an  Intra-EEA  voyage,  and  only 50% of the energy falls under   the scope of this Regulation. A complete set of examples and the corresponding Article numbers are listed in Table 10. At the time of publication, Member States notified the Commission of a list of exempted OMR ports (Article 2(4)). Some examples do not include specific OMR ports and are shown with grey text, but they are retained in the table to illustrate the functioning of Article 2(1)(c) once Article 2(4) exemption expires in 2030.

The FuelEU approach differs from the EU ETS approach, as outlined in Table 11. FuelEU provides this exemption on a permanent basis, while the EU ETS Directive covers the period up to 31 December 2030 (see EU ETS guidance document n°1 46 ). The fuel consumption of voyages  from/to  OMR  should  be  monitored  and  reported.  However,  from  2031,  for  the purpose  of  calculating  the  yearly  average  GHG  intensity  of  energy  used  on  board,  the energy scope will be reduced accordingly.

## 2.2.2. Voyages to ports identified as neighbouring transhipment ports

Similar  to  the  concept  used  under  the  MRV/ETS,  FuelEU  stipulates  that  stops  made  by containerships  at  a  neighbouring  container  transhipment  port,  as  listed  in  the  relevant implementing act adopted by the Commission, are excluded from the definition of a port of call.  At the time of writing this document, this act is pending adoption. In the draft available for public consultation,  the  following  ports  were  identified  as  neighbouring  container transhipment ports:

- East Port Said, Egypt
- Tanger Med, Morocco

This  list  aligns  with  the  respective  list  under  MRV/ETS  (Implementing  Regulation  (EU) 2023/2297), thereby aligning the definitions of voyages under  FuelEU and EU MRV. Stops made by containerships at the ports identified in the adopted act are considered  part of  a  voyage.  The  scope  of  the  voyage  and  the  energy  contribution,  as  per  Article  2(1), depends  on  the  vessel's  last  port  of  call  and  the  next  port  of  call.  Consequently,  the respective voyage will always fall under one of the predefined voyage categories, eliminating the need for specific calculation examples.

## 2.2.3. Small islands - Article 2(3)

## Regulatory reference

Article  2(3) of FuelEU allows Member States to request exemptions for the energy used by ships on specific routes and in ports served by passenger ships, other than cruise ships . This applies to routes connecting a port of a Member State with small islands of the same Member State that have a population of fewer than 200,000, as well as the duration of stay within a port of that island.

Member States should notify the European Commission of these exemption requests, which will be published by the Commission in the Official Journal of the EU. They are subject to a time limit, expiring no later than 31 December 2029 .

The following Member States have requested exemptions for their small islands shown in Table 12.

The FuelEU approach differs from the EU ETS approach. FuelEU provides for this possible exemption  with  an  expiration  date  no  later  than  31  December  2029,  while  the  EU  ETS directive  covers  the  period  up  to  31  December  2030  (see  EU  ETS  guidance  document n°1 55 ).  Additionally,  FuelEU  exempts  only  the  port  of  call  of  the  low-populated  island,  not both  ports  of  call  for  the  specific  voyage.  For  differences  between  EU  ETS  and  FuelEU obligations for specific voyage examples, consult the list of exempted islands under the EU ETS Directive and FuelEU.

## Energy falling under the scope of FuelEU

The energy consumption of these voyages as well as the relevant port of calls, should be monitored  and reported. However, for the purpose of calculating the yearly average GHG intensity of energy used on board, the energy scope will be reduced accordingly.

Even  though  exempted  voyages  and  port  stays  do  not  contribute  to  the  FuelEU  energy scope, fuels used during these voyages and port stays may still be allocated to the annual FuelEU  scope  of  energy.  This applies if there are voyages or port stays in the Reporting Period that fall under the FuelEU scope. For more information on fuel allocation, see Section 2.5.

## 2.2.4. Voyages between outermost region ports - Article 2(4)

## Regulatory reference

In  addition  to  the  permanent  exemption provided by Article 2(1) of FuelEU (see previous section),  Article  2(4)  allows  Member  States  to  request  exemptions  from  the  regulation's scope for specific routes and ports. This applies to the energy used by ships on voyages between port of calls in OMRs, and during their stay within the ports of call in those ports. Moreover, all ports of call within the exempted OMR ports are excluded from application of FuelEU Article 2(1), regardless of previous or next port of call.

Member States should notify the European Commission of these exemption requests, which will  be  published  by  the  Commission in the Official  Journal  of  the European Union. These exemptions  are subject to a time limit, expiring no later than 31 December 2029 .

At  the  time  of  writing,  the  following  Member  States  have  requested  exemptions for their OMRs:

## Energy falling under the scope of FuelEU

The  energy  consumption  of  voyages  between  two  ports  of  call  located in the concerned OMRs, as well as emissions within these ports of call, should be monitored and reported. However, for the purpose of calculating  the yearly average GHG intensity of energy used on board, the energy scope will be reduced accordingly.

Even  though  exempted  voyages  and  port  stays  do  not  contribute  to  the  FuelEU  energy scope 62 fuels used during these voyages and port stays may still be allocated to the annual FuelEU  scope  of  energy.  This applies if there are voyages or port stays in the Reporting Period that fall under the FuelEU scope. For more information on fuel allocation, see Section 2.5.

## 2.2.5. Public service obligations or public service contracts - Article 2(5) and 2(6)

Articles 2(5) and 2(6) of FuelEU allow Member States to request complete exemptions from FuelEU for:

- Passenger ships performing public service obligations/contracts between a port of a Member State that does not share a land border with any other Member State and ports of other Member States.
- Specific  routes  served  by  passenger  ships  providing  maritime  transport  services under  EU  'cabotage'  rules  (Regulation  (EEC)  No  3577/92  under  public  service obligations/contracts, operating before 12 October 2023, between the mainland and an  island  of  the  same  Member  State  or  the  cities  of  Ceuta  and  Melilla).  For  the purposes of this exemption, the cities of Ceuta and Melilla will be considered as ports of call located on an island.

Member States should notify the European Commission of these exemption requests, which will be published by the Commission in the Official Journal of the EU. At the time of writing, the following Member States have requested exemptions related to public service obligations and contracts:

62  FuelEU energy scope should be understood as the energy used throughout voyages and port of calls within the scope of the Regulation, reduced respectively as per Article 2.1(c), 2.1(d) and Articles 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6.

## In addition, the following items related to energy consumption should be reported:

- The amount of electricity delivered to the ship via on-shore power supply (OPS)
- The amount of energy from a zero-emission technology consumed at berth
- The amount of each type of substitute source of energy consumed at sea

## 2.4. Mass of Fuel used for Establishing GHG Intensity of Energy used Onboard a Ship

Annex I of the FuelEU provides:

The [Mi] mass of fuel must be determined using the amount reported under Regulation (EU) 2015/757 for voyages within the scope of this Regulation, based on the monitoring methodology chosen by the company.

To  determine  the  fuel  quantity  consumed,  the  MRV  Maritime  Regulation 65 allows  three different approaches: method A, method B or method C.

65  For more information, see Regulation (EU) 2015/757.

The European Sustainable Shipping Forum (ESSF) provides a platform for structural dialogue, exchange of technical knowledge, cooperation and coordination between the Commission, Member States' authorities and maritime transport stakeholders on issues pertaining to the sustainability and the competitiveness of EU maritime transport. This document has not

Additionally,  for  the  purpose of determining GHG emissions directly, a measurement-based approach (method D) may be used. In such cases, fuel consumption should still be reported, which can be done through back-calculation using emissions and the CO2 emission factor. However,  it  is  beneficial  to  use  a  second  monitoring  method  to  verify  the  results  of  the primary method. Generally, back-calculation should be considered a secondary option. It is recommended to use a supplementary method (method A, method B, method C) to directly determine fuel consumption utilized in reporting.

The  above  quoted  definition  provided  in  FuelEU  Annex  I  implies  that fuel  quantities reported for MRV  Regulation and FuelEU should be consistent , to limit the administrative burden imposed on shipping companies, verifiers and competent authorities. Fuel quantities should be grouped according to the categories indicated in Section 2.3 and as set out by Implementing Regulation 2023/2449, which provides the template for the MRV Emission Report.

As  outlined  in  earlier  sections,  FuelEU  may  not  apply  to  all  energy  used  on  monitored voyages. Voyage-specific and ship-specific deductions will lead to differences between the mass of fuel reported for both monitoring schemes and the mass of fuel used to establish the GHG intensity of the energy used on board a ship, to calculate the compliance balance and to determine FuelEU penalties. For example, for a vessel performing Extra-EEA or voyages within the scope of any of the exemptions described in Section 2.2, the mass of fuel used for calculating  the  greenhouse  gas  intensity  will  be  reduced  according  to  the  actual  FuelEU energy scope. Subsequent calculation steps, illustrated in Figure 3, demonstrate how input data representing the fuel consumption reporting for EU MRV purposes is used in FuelEU calculations.

## 2.5. Allocation of Fuels

FuelEU  does  not  prescribe  a  specific  methodology  for  allocating  fuels  to  complete  the energy  scope  under  Article  2.  The  European  Commission  Questions  and  Answers  on FuelEU  webpage 66   states  that  allocation  of  fuels  is  possible  in  the  calculation  of  the contribution to the GHG  intensity of the  covered  energy.  In  absence  of  a  defined methodology  in  the  legislative  text  and  based  on  the  interpretation  in  the  Questions  and Answers, it is understood that the fuels used on different types of voyages or port calls can be freely allocated to meet the total energy scope within one calendar year, provided they

have  been  reported  under  the  MRV  Regulation. Thus,  allocation  can  consider  the intensity  associated  with  different  fuel  types  across  any  fuel  class, based  on  their respective emission factors,  as  well  as  the  emission  factors  linked  to  different  fuel consumers.

For example, LNG used in multiple onboard engines with different slippage coefficients can be allocated according to their intensity. Since reporting of fuels under the MRV Regulation and FuelEU is on component basis, it is also possible to de-couple component blends and allocate them to FuelEU energy scope separately. However, it is not permitted to report fuel consumption of a fuel blend in proportions different from the actual proportion of components in  a  fuel  blend,  even  if  the  amounts  of  fuel  under  each  component  of  the  blend  can  be allocated  freely  (e.g.  the  bio-diesel  component  of  a  B30  blend  with  fossil  fuel  oil  can  be allocated independently from the fossil fuel component).

Lastly,  sources  of  energy  other  than  traditional  fuels  (such  as  electricity)  can  be  also allocated  to  the  FuelEU  energy  scope.  Electricity  may  form  part  of  the  energy  used  on Extra-EEA voyages, in the case of use of OPS during an intermediate stop forming part of a FuelEU/MRV voyage, or in case of hybrid or other innovative propulsion systems.

## 2.6. Step-by-Step Guidance for Extra-EEA Voyages

This Section includes a total of four examples aiming to clarify calculation principles where, unlike the examples in Section 1.4, a portion of energy used throughout voyages and port of calls contribute to the energy falling under the scope of FuelEU.

The following are calculation steps specific to such scenarios:

1. Determine energy used per voyage/port of call using mass of each fuel type and respective LCVs. Add consumption of electrical energy where applicable.
2. For each voyage/port of call, calculate the energy in scope of the Regulation , as per Article 2(1) and consider exemptions given through Articles 2(3), 2(4), 2(5), 2(6). Add the individual leg contribution to determine total FuelEU energy scope.
3. Allocate  different  sources  of  energy  considered under  point  1,  until  FuelEU energy scope is covered. Using LCV, obtain fuel mass per each respective fuel type and energy from electricity allocated to FuelEU energy scope.
4. Calculate  GHG  intensity  and  FuelEU  Compliance  Balance using  fuel  masses determined under point 3) as well as energy from electricity, if applicable, by using principles outlined in Chapter 1.

## Example 1: General case

Figure 4 illustrates the most beneficial allocation of fuels to the FuelEU energy scope. In the assumed scenario, the vessel performed several Extra-EEA voyages, which, as per Article 2(1)(d), reduced the energy in scope of FuelEU. The overall voyage pattern in the Reporting Period year resulted in approximately a 40% reduction in the FuelEU energy scope (from 58,105  GJ  to  35,000  GJ).  Considering  the  fuel  mix,  which  includes  energy  from  OPS, certified  bio-diesel,  MDO,  LFO  and  HFO,  the  most  favourable  fuels  are  used  first  in  the calculation of GHG intensity. This increases the impact of using low-GHG-intensity energy

sources on the compliance balance, effectively incentivizing the introduction of such energy sources into the energy mix up to the amount of energy in scope of FuelEU.

Fuels  used  during  voyages  outside  the  scope  of   MRV  and FuelEU reporting cannot be allocated to the FuelEU  energy  scope  (e.g., fuels  used  on  voyages  between  two non-Member  State  ports).  However,  fuels  used  during  voyages  and  port  calls  exempted under Articles 2(3), 2(4), 2(5), and 2(6) may be allocated to the FuelEU energy scope as long as there are other voyages and port calls that contribute to the FuelEU energy scope source (e.g., intra-EU voyages within the same calendar year).

For all  practical  purposes,  all  examples  in  this  document  assume  allocation of fuels to the FuelEU energy scope is optimized to the benefit of the ship's compliance balance.

## Example 2: LNG used on Extra-EEA voyages with different slippage coefficients

This  example serves to illustrate the allocation of fuels to the FuelEU energy scope for a vessel performing a voyage from a non-Member State port to a Member State port and a return  voyage  to  the  same  non-Member  State  port.  In the assumed scenario, the vessel uses LNG for its main engines, auxiliary engines and boiler. Additionally, MDO and HFO are used as pilot fuel and during diesel-only mode operations within port of call.

The  Well-to-Wake  GHG  intensity for the voyage sequence, calculated in accordance with Chapter 1, using fuel mass determined per each fuel, is equal to 75.93 gCO 2eq/MJ.

The  principles  presented  in  this  example  can  be  directly  applied  to  bio-methane  and e-methane scenarios. The overall principle applies to any voyage sequence where the fuel mix consists of fuels with different GHG intensities. It is important to note that allocation has been applied as if the three legs (extra-EU,port of call, extra-EU) were the only legs within the scope of FuelEU in the calendar year. If there were more legs within the scope of the Regulation,  the  most  beneficial  fuel  allocation  might  differ.  For  instance,  if  the  vessel consumed bio-methane on other voyages and within port calls, bio-methane could partially or completely displace fossil fuels from the FuelEU energy fuel mix.

67  As per EU ETS and MRV guidance document no.1, Chapter 7.4.2: Where default slippage coefficients are not listed for a specific emission source class, companies should apply a slippage coefficient of zero.

69  FuelEU mass contribution should be understood as the mass of each fuel type [Mi ] taken into consideration for the purpose of establishing greenhouse gas intensity of energy used onboard a ship. 68  FuelEU energy contribution should be understood as the energy contribution from each fuel type towards the FuelEU energy. Where equal to zero, specific fuel type is not taken into account in the GHG intensity calculations due to application of the most beneficial allocation principles.

## Example 3: Sustainable biofuel used on EEA-outgoing voyage

This example illustrates a scenario where a   vessel arrives at a Member State port from a non-Member  State  port  and  then departs from the Member  State  port to  another non-Member  State  port. In this scenario, the vessel uses fossil fuels (MDO and HFO) en route to the Member State port and within the port of call. However, on the outgoing leg, a biofuel bunkered in the Member State port, fulfilling the certification criteria of FuelEU Article 10, is  used.  The  WtW GHG intensity of the biofuel batch is assumed in this example to be 18.6 gCO2eq/MJ and LCV equal to 37 MJ/kg. It is noteworthy that the bio-diesel could be a component in a physical blend (e.g., B30), in which case the fossil and biofuel components are to be reported separately and allocated independently, similarly to how it is calculated in this example.

Considering that biofuel is used on a voyage where the energy is not entirely applicable to the  FuelEU  energy  scope,  this  low-GHG  intensity  fuel  displaces  other  fuels  used on the voyage arriving at the Member State port and fuels used within the port call under the  scope of  the  Regulation.  This  example  illustrates  a  scenario  where  the  entirety  of  sustainable biofuel  used  by  the  ship  is  not  allocated  to  FuelEU  energy  scope.  While  such  a  scenario might not be preferable to a shipping company, it may occur if the FuelEU energy scope is relatively  small  compared  to  used  quantities of low GHG intensity fuels. As mentioned in Example 2, the allocation is applied as if the three legs were the only legs in scope of the Regulation in the calendar year. If there are other voyages within the scope of the Regulation in  the  same  year,  the  remaining  mass  of biofuel may be allocated to the FuelEU energy scope to displace fuels of higher GHG intensity. If this is not the case, it is not possible to 'bank' the surplus from the biofuel mass to a different calendar year or pool it with another ship.

The  Well-to-Wake  GHG  intensity for the voyage sequence, calculated in accordance with Chapter 1, using fuel mass determined per each fuel, is equal to 18.6 gCO 2eq/MJ.

The principles used in this example apply similarly to voyages that arrive at or depart from a port  of  call  located  in  an  OMR  under  the  jurisdiction  of  a  Member  State,  following  Article 2(1)(c). Since most, if not all, OMR ports are covered by Article 2(4), a separate example is not  provided  to  illustrate  a  voyage  applicable  for  a  50%  energy  scope  deduction  as  per Article 2(1)(c).

## Example 4: Voyages excluded under Article 2(3), 2(4), 2(5) or 2(6)

To   further clarify fuel allocation, it is necessary to illustrate that all fuels reported under the scope of the MRV Regulation can be allocated to meet the total FuelEU energy scope within one calendar year. In the constructed example, a voyage between two OMR ports excluded under FuelEU Article 2(4) is the first leg considered in the calculation, followed by a port of call in the OMR port, which is also excluded under Article 2(4). The last leg in the example is a  voyage  between  OMR  port  and  Member  State  port,  which  is  an  intra-EU  voyage, nevertheless covered by Article 2(1)(c). For better understanding of the principles, fuel used throughout a fully exempted voyage and port of call is assumed to be a biofuel fulfilling the certification criteria of FuelEU Article 10, while fuels used on a voyage where 50% energy is covered  are  fossil  fuels.  The  WtW  GHG  intensity  of the biofuel batch is assumed in this example to be 18.6 gCO2eq/MJ and LCV equal to 37 MJ/kg.

The  Well-to-Wake  GHG  intensity for the voyage sequence, calculated in accordance with Chapter 1, using fuel mass determined per each fuel, is equal to 18.6 gCO 2eq/MJ.

The  resulting  FuelEU  fuel  mix  demonstrates  that  the  use  of  low-GHG  intensity  fuels  on exempted  voyages  is  incentivized  equally  to  any  other  voyages, with the FuelEU energy scope being covered by bio-diesel.

Principles  used  in  this  example  apply  similarly  to  voyages  or  port  calls  exempted  under Articles 2(3), 2(5), and 2(6) of the FuelEU. Given the limited number of ships benefiting from these Articles, specific examples are not provided.

In  cases where vessels benefit from Articles 2(3), 2(4), 2(5) or 2(6) for most or all voyages and port calls within a calendar year, as explained in Example 3, it is not possible to bank a surplus of low-GHG intensity fuel to another calendar year or share it between ships if the FuelEU energy scope is relatively small and does not accommodate the entirety of low-GHG intensity fuel mass.

FuelEU applies a differentiated approach depending on whether a voyage is Intra-EEA or Extra-EEA,  and  whether  it  involves  OMRs  or  small  island  ports  exempted  under  the regulation.  This  creates  opportunities  for  strategic  fuel  allocation  and  places  emphasis  on accurate reporting and careful interpretation of exemptions. Building on this foundation, the next chapter examines how specific technologies and fuel types, such as wind propulsion and onshore power, influence a ship's compliance balance under FuelEU.

## 3. Chapter 3: Technology-specific Calculations

## 3.1. Introduction

This Chapter is focused on technology-specific FuelEU compliance balance results , i.e., the impact of those technologies on the yearly compliance balance (in mass gCO2eq), as the measure of a ship's over- or under-compliance under FuelEU (see Section 1.3 ) . The specific technologies and fuels covered include:

- Ice  classed  vessel and navigation  in ice : Calculation  of  fuel  consumption adjustments;
- Wind-assisted propulsion : Effects of reward factors and operational fuel consumption;
- Biomethane : Impact of negative emissions on compliance;
- Low-carbon  and  recycled  fuels :  Future  eligibility  and  main  differences  from Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBOs or e-fuels);
- Zero Emission Technologies at berth (Annex III technologies) :  Impact  of  using Zero Emission Technologies at berth on the final yearly compliance balance.

This  document  does not include  calculations  or  demonstrations  related  to  GHG  or sustainability  certification  of  marine  bunker  fuels.  Current  calculations  start  with  the  GHG emission  value  of  fuels,  in  gCO 2 eq/MJ,  as  determined  at  point  of  delivery  to  the  ship (bunkering)  and  as  stated  on the Proof of Sustainability (PoS) or equivalent document of compliance provided to the ship. For guidance on certification requirements of fuels related to  FuelEU  and  EU  ETS  compliance,  refer  to  the  SAPS  WS2  document  titled 'Report on Marine Fuels Certification Procedures to support implementation of FuelEU.' 70

Finally,  any  examples and conclusions in this Chapter are illustrative and non-exhaustive. They are intended only as guidance for a shipping company to conduct its own more comprehensive calculations and analyses following FuelEU calculation principles and other considerations . This document does not constitute an endorsement or recommendation for adopting  particular technologies.

## 3.2. Key Concepts and Definitions

## 3.3. Technology-specific Calculations

## 3.3.1. Ice class and ice navigation

## Annex IV of FuelEU provides that:

for  any  ship  having  the  ice  class  IC,  IB,  IA  or  IA  Super  or  an  equivalent  ice  class,  the company  may  request,  until  31  December  2034,  to  exclude  the  additional  energy consumption, due to sailing in ice conditions. For any ship having the ice class IA or IA Super  or  an  equivalent  ice  class,  the  company  may  request  to  exclude  the  additional energy consumption, due to the technical characteristics of the ship .

The  fuel  consumption  of  voyages  by  ships  with   ice  class  IC,  IB,  IA  or  IA  Super,  or  an equivalent  ice  class,  should  be  monitored  and  reported.  However,  for  the  purpose  of calculating the yearly average GHG intensity of energy used on board, the energy scope will be reduced according to Annex V of FuelEU. This derogation is in the form of an adjusted amount of fuel mass under the scope of FuelEU targets, awarded to these ships since they consume more fuel navigating in ice compared to periods sailing in open water. An additional derogation is awarded if the vessel has ice class IA or IA Super, or an equivalent ice class, as these vessels are at a disadvantage from an energy efficiency design perspective. Both derogations are expressed as a combined deduction in the mass of fuels that fall under the scope of FuelEU calculation (Annex I and IV), as described in the methodology of Annex V of the Regulation.

To  deduct  a  mass  of  fuels  from  FuelEU  scope  due  to  ice  class  and  navigation  in  ice (combined),  an adjusted  mass  of  fuel  Mi,A is  calculated  according  to  Annex  V  of  the Regulation.  This  adjusted  mass  is  then  used instead  of  the  mass  of  fuels Mi when calculating  a  ship's  GHG  intensity  according  to  Annex  I,  as  well  as  in  calculating  the compliance balance and FuelEU penalty according to Annex IV of the Regulation.

## Calculations Example

In  this  section,  a  calculation  example  is  provided  for  a  ship  with  ice  class  1A  Super undertaking a 2-day voyage of 600 nautical miles, with 75 nautical miles navigated under ice conditions. It  is  assumed that the vessel consumes 7.5 tonnes of LFO (ISO 8217 Grades RMA to RMD) while navigating in ice, out of a total voyage consumption of 51.25 tonnes of LFO in both ice and open-water conditions. These fuel consumption amounts and distances are assumed to be entirely within the scope of the Regulation, as further explained in the note on Extra-EEA voyages.

## Note on Extra-EEA voyages:

The starting point of the Regulation's Annex V 'Calculation of adjusted mass of fuel for ice navigation' is the energy used and distance sailed 'within the scope of this Regulation', according to definitions in Annex V:

"Mi, voyages, total " (and "Mi,voyages,ice conditions ") denotes the mass of fuel i consumed for all voyages (or for "Mi,voyages,ice conditions " for sailing in ice conditions) within the scope of this Regulation .

'Dtotal '  (and  'D ice  conditions ')  denotes  the  aggregated annual distance travelled (or for 'Dice conditions ' when sailing in ice conditions) within the scope of this Regulation .

The  key  aspect  in  these  definitions  is  the  expression,  " within  the  scope  of  this Regulation ", which limits the scope of Annex V calculations to 50% of the energy use and distance sailed between EEA and non-EEA port calls, as well as all other exemptions from the "scope of this Regulation", as provided in Article 2 (Scope) of the Regulation.

Therefore,  for  the  current  calculation  example,  all  fuel  (energy)  amounts  and  distances sailed are already limited to the scope of the Regulation, i.e. after deducting all energy used  and  distance  sailed  that  is not within  scope  of  the  Regulation,  and  allocations thereof, as illustrated in Chapter 2 (Extra-EEA Voyages).

Example: for  voyages  between EEA and non-EEA port calls, Dtotal is already 50% of the total  distance  travelled,  and  D ice is  also  50%  of  the  distance  travelled  in  ice  conditions. Same for Mi, voyages, total and Mi,voyages,ice conditions , which are each 50% of the total and 'in ice' fuel consumption (respectively) on voyages between EEA and non-EEA port calls.

Table 24 shows a breakdown of the relevant numbers needed for the calculation, with the corresponding  notation  used  in  Annex  V  where  appropriate.  Although  the  notation  from Annex V is used throughout, the calculations are presented in a different order than in Annex V for simplicity  of  understanding.  In  this document the formulas are presented in the order required for calculating the results.

|                                           | Fuel in open water (LFO) | 43.75 tonnes  |
| LCV LFO                                   | Lower calorific value    | 0.041 MJ/gram |

The  steps  to  calculate  the  adjusted  mass  of  fuel  are  outlined.  Example  calculations  are shown in blue text.

## Step 1: Calculate energy used in ice and open water.

Energy for each sailing condition is calculated using the tonnes of fuel and corresponding Lower Calorific Value (LCV).

## Step 2: Calculate the adjusted energy in ice conditions.

The adjusted energy in ice conditions represents the baseline energy in open water that the vessel sailing in ice would have used if it had been sailing in open waters. In other words, this  is  the reference energy that the ship would have consumed over the distance sailed in ice, D ice conditions , had the ship sailed in open water. This baseline is calculated as:

## Note on cases where a ship navigates in ice throughout the entire Reporting Period:

In  the  event  that a ship sails under ice conditions for the entire duration of the Reporting Period, the formula E voyages, ice conditions, adjusted cannot be computed due to a 'divided by zero' error. This occurs because the total distance would be under ice conditions, i.e. D total = Dice conditions ,  and  fuel consumption occurs only under ice conditions, i.e. E voyages, total = Evoyages, ice conditions , resulting in:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

While  the  situation  of  only  sailing  in  ice  is  admittedly  rare,  the  Regulation  does  not currently  provide  a  solution  for  this  possibility.  Some  potential  solutions  might include (if accepted by the verifier) using additional data to prove the increased fuel consumption of the vessel due to sailing in ice conditions versus open water conditions, by  referring to previous Reporting Periods. Alternatively, in extreme cases, the ship could be re-routed to perform open water navigation at least once during the Reporting Period.

## Step 3: Calculate the additional energy due to ice conditions

The additional energy due to ice conditions, which is ultimately to be deducted from the total fuel consumption to account for  the excess consumption from navigating in ice, is calculated as  the  total  energy  minus  the  open  water  energy  and  the  adjusted  ice  condition  energy (open-water baseline for the distance sailed in ice). As set out in Annex V, there is a cap on the amount of energy that can be deducted, which is presented as a cap on the additional ice condition energy, and is set at 1.3 times the open water energy.

Step 4: Calculate the additional energy due to ice class

```

Step 5: Calculate the total additional energy due to ice.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

## Note on cases with multiple fuel types :

It  should  be  noted  that  the  above example is simplified, as most vessels consume more than  one  type  of  fuel.  In  such  cases,  the  final  calculation  of  adjusted  mass  of  fuel allows shipping companies to allocate the deduction (𝑀 𝑖, 𝐴 =  𝑀 𝑖 -  𝐸 𝑖, 𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑡𝑜 𝑖𝑐𝑒 / 𝐿𝐶𝑉 𝑖 ) due to ice class and navigation to the fuels with highest GHG intensity , provided there is sufficient fuel amount  Mi  to  subtract  from  as . This  is -  𝐸 𝑖, 𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑡𝑜 𝑖𝑐𝑒 / 𝐿𝐶𝑉 𝑖 expressed in Annex V of the Regulation as:

The company shall allocate the total additional ice energy to 𝐸 𝑖 𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑖𝑐𝑒 the different fuels i used during the year, with the following conditions:

This creates a further incentive for the uptake of low-GHG intensity fuels when operating an ice-classed vessel and for vessels navigating in ice.

Finally, in order to calculate the effects on FuelEU compliance, the adjusted mass of fuel M i,A is applied to the calculation of GHG intensity and compliance balance formulas of Annexes I and  IV,  respectively  (see  Chapter  1).  In  Table  25,  an  example  of  the  final  voyage  result demonstrates  the  benefits  in  terms  of  compliance  balance  and  FuelEU  penalty  for  the current  example.  As  a  result  of  applying  the  ice  derogation,  the  compliance  deficit  and respective  FuelEU  penalty  are  both  reduced,  saving  around  200€  in  FuelEU  penalties related  to  that  single  voyage:  a  reduced  penalty  of  €2,564,  instead  of  a  baseline  €2,767 penalty without ice derogation.

## 3.3.2. Wind-assisted propulsion

FuelEU rewards wind-assisted propulsion by considering a reward factor fwind. This factor is applied in the GHG intensity formula (Equation 1 of Annex I of the FuelEU) which helps bring the actual GHG intensity of a ship closer or beyond the ship GHG intensity targets set in Article 4.

An additional positive consequence of installing wind-assisted propulsion for non-compliant vessels under FuelEU (e.g., a ship running solely on fossil fuels or not using enough low GHG fuels  to  reach  the  GHG  intensity  targets)  is a reduction in fuel consumption during operation.  This  results  in  a  lower  compliance  deficit  and  a  correspondingly  lower  FuelEU penalty.

The reward factor as set out in Annex I is as follows: 𝑓 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑

|   𝑓 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑 | 𝑃 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑 / 𝑃 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝            |
|----------|----------------------------|
|     1    | <0.05 𝑃 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑 /𝑃 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝       |

|     0.95 | 0.15 ≤ 𝑃 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑 / 𝑃 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝     |

## Mid-year installation

The  reward  factor  is  calculated  at  the  end  of  the  Reporting  Period  based  on  verified documentation  available  on  31  December  of  the  Reporting  Period.  To  be  eligible for the reward  factor,  the  EEDI/EEXI  technical  file  should  be  updated and verified to include the calculation of wind-assisted propulsion contribution. In the case of mid-year installation, the same reward factor is applied for the entire year. Currently FuelEU only specifies in Annex I that:

GHG intensity index of the ship is (...) calculated by multiplying the result of Equation (1) by the reward factor and no further detailed methodology  is provided on how  to handle  periods  when wind-assisted  propulsion installation had not yet been verified within the Reporting Period according to EEDI for new ships (IMO resolution MEPC.364(79)) or the 2021 guidelines on the method of calculation of the attained EEXI (IMO resolution MEPC.333(76)). Therefore, the reward factor applies to the entire Equation 1 of Annex I of FuelEU, meaning the entire Reporting Period (see calculation Example 1).

## 3.3.3 Wind-assisted propulsion examples

Table 26 presents three scenarios that demonstrate the impact of wind-assisted propulsion on FuelEU compliance balance, GHG intensity, and associated penalties. These examples vary by installation timing, reward, and propulsion, illustrating how different design and operational choices impact compliance outcomes.

75 EEXI evaluates the energy efficiency of existing ships to meet specific standards, while the EEDI assesses new ships' designs for compliance with IMO energy efficiency criteria. An overview and links to resolutions can be found here:

For  demonstration  purposes,  the  ship  in this calculation example consumes the following amounts  during  one  full  Reporting  Period  as  a baseline  case  without  wind-assisted propulsion .

## Fuel consumption baseline:

- 12,000 tonnes Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) used in main engines for propulsion, and
- 1,400 tonnes Marine Gas Oil (MDO/MGO) used for auxiliary power.

For  the  same ship with installed wind-assisted propulsion ,  the  following  assumption  is made' a reduction in HFO consumption is achieved in the second half of year 2025, i.e., after the installation. In this example, the reduction is  estimated at approximately 12.5% savings for  half  of  the  year.  Note  that  this  is  an  arbitrary value and that actual fuel consumption in operation will depend on various factors related to the ship, operational profile, and weather conditions on the actual route.

## Fuel consumption with savings from wind-assisted propulsion:

- 11,250 tonnes HFO used in main engines for propulsion, and
- 1,400 tonnes MDO/MGO used for auxiliary power.

Note on Example 1 in Table 26: Where it is noted that the compliance balance improves by  1,490  tonnes CO2eq due to lower achieved GHG intensity relative  to  the  baseline without  wind-assisted  propulsion  (91.64 → 88.88 gCO2eq/MJ). This improvement is the result  of  applying  the reward factor fwind . Since the achieved GHG intensity is below the 2025  target (89.34 gCO2eq/MJ),  there is  no  FuelEU  penalty  associated  with  this wind-assisted  propulsion  example,  resulting  in  a  100%  reduction  in  the  penalty.  It  is noteworthy that the reduction in yearly fuel consumption has a negative effect on the amount  of  compliance  surplus  generated:  234  tonnes  CO2eq of compliance balance is generated in this example, which is lower than in a case without a reduction in operational fuel  consumption in the baseline (i.e., if the wind-assisted propulsion equipment was not operational  and  HFO  consumption  was  12,000  tonnes).  In  the case of higher baseline consumption, the compliance surplus would instead be 245 tonnes CO2eq, but this would come at the cost of higher fuel consumption (12,000 tonnes instead of 11,250 tonnes).

## Example 2: Full reporting period

A  ship  has  an  approved  EEDI/EEXI  technical  file for a full Reporting Period. The ship is equipped with engine power limitation (EPL) and wind-assisted propulsion.

According to the EEDI/EEXI technical file, is 1,100kW and the is 10,000 kW. The 𝑃 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑 𝑃 𝑀𝐸 considered is:

For demonstration purposes, a baseline ship without wind-assisted propulsion consumes the same amount of fuel as in the previous example (12,000 tonnes HFO and 1,400 tonnes MGO).

For the same ship with installed wind-assisted propulsion , it is assumed that some HFO consumption reduction is achieved throughout the entire year. In this example, the reduction is estimated at approximately 15% savings for the entire year. As with the first example, this is  an  arbitrary  value,  actual  values  depend  on  a  number  of  factors  related  to  the  ship, operational profile, and weather conditions on the actual route.

## Fuel consumption with savings from wind-assisted propulsion:

- 10,200 tonnes Heavy Fuel Oil, HFO, used in main engines for propulsion, and
- 1,400 tonnes Marine Gas Oil, MDO/MGO, used for auxiliary power.

Note on Example 2 in Table 26: Where it is noted that the compliance balance improves by 2,341 tonnes CO2eq due to the lower achieved GHG intensity relative to the baseline without  wind-assisted  propulsion  (91.64 → 87.04 gCO2eq/MJ). This improvement is the result  of  applying  the reward factor fwind . Since the achieved GHG intensity is below the 2025  target (89.34 gCO2eq/MJ),  there is  no  FuelEU  penalty  associated  with  this wind-assisted propulsion example, resulting in a  100% reduction in the penalty.

As  with  the  first  example,  the reduction  in yearly fuel consumption has a negative effect on the amount  of compliance  surplus generated: 1,086 tonnes  of  CO2eq compliance balance is generated in this example, which is lower than in a case without a reduction  in  operational  fuel  consumption  in  the  baseline  (i.e.  if  the  wind-assisted propulsion equipment was not operational and HFO consumption was 12,000 tonnes). In the case of  higher baseline consumption, the compliance surplus would instead be 1,245 tonnes  CO2eq,  but  this   would  come  at  the  cost  of  a  higher  fuel  consumption  (12,000 tonnes instead of 10,200 tonnes).

## Example 3: Non-conventional propulsion

The ship has non-conventional propulsion (diesel-electric) and is therefore exempted from reaching  the  EEDI/EEXI  target,  but  the  ship  still  needs  to  generate  and  submit  an EEDI/EEDI technical file for verification. Thus, following the same principles and verification as would have been required for EEDI/EEXI target, the power used for propulsion is in this example 7,000kW, and the respective reference vessel speed is 16kn. Also, the Pwind at a ship speed of 16kn is 400 kW in this example.

## Calculation of the reward factor is as follows:

For demonstration purposes, a baseline ship without wind-assisted propulsion consumes the same amounts as in the previous example (12,000 tonnes HFO and 1,400 tonnes MGO).

It  is  assumed  that  with  wind-assisted  propulsion,  a  reduction  in  HFO  consumption  is achieved throughout the year. In this example, the reduction is estimated at approximately 7.5%. As with previous examples this is an arbitrary value, actual values will rely on various factors related to the ship, its operational profile and weather conditions on the actual route.

## Fuel consumption with savings from wind-assisted propulsion:

- 11,100 tonnes Heavy Fuel Oil, HFO, used in main engines for propulsion, and
- 1,400 tonnes Marine Gas Oil, MDO/MGO, used for auxiliary power.

Example 3 results in Table 26 show that the compliance balance improves by 554 tonnes CO2eq due to lower achieved GHG intensity relative to the baseline without wind-assisted propulsion (91.64 → 90.71 gCO2eq/MJ). This improvement is attributed to  the application of the reward factor fwind . However,  the achieved GHG intensity is not compliant with the 2025 target  (89.34  gCO 2 eq/MJ),  resulting  in  a  compliance  deficit  of  -701  tonnes  CO2eq and a FuelEU penalty of ~€ 0.45 million. Despite having a penalty, it is significantly lower than the baseline  penalty  without  wind-assisted  propulsion  (~€0.8  million),  due  to  the combined effect  of  the  reward  factor  fwind  and  reduced  operational  fuel  consumption .  The reduction in  yearly  fuel  consumption  positively  impacts the compliance  deficit, decreasing  it  by  54  tonnes  CO2eq compared to the baseline scenario without operational wind-assisted propulsion equipment and with HFO consumption of 12,000 tonnes. In such a scenario  with  higher  consumption  (wind-assisted  propulsion installed, but not in use), the compliance  deficit  would  be  -755  tonnes  CO 2 eq,  leading  to  a   higher  FuelEU penalty of ~€0.487 million (example 3.2.3 with 12,000 tonnes HFO / year), instead of ~€0.452 million (example 3.2.3 with 11,100 tonnes HFO / year).

## 3.4. Biomethane: Negative or Zero WtT Emissions

FuelEU  recognizes  that  biogas  can  be  utilized  to  meet  a  ship's  GHG  intensity reduction targets. 79  'Biogas' is defined as gaseous fuels produced from biomass, which can be purified to  natural gas quality, resulting in biomethane. 80 Biomethane can then be further liquified to produce  liquified  biomethane,  or  'Bio-LNG'  as  it  is  called  in  the  FuelEU,  using  the  same

79  Article 10(1a) of Regulation (EU) 2023/1805. The biogas must derive from waste and residues from Annex IX Part A of Directive (EU) 2018/2001, and not from food/feed crops.

liquefaction  process as fossil-based natural gas to LNG. Bio-LNG, like all non-fossil fuels, should be certified under a voluntary scheme recognized by the European Commission. 81

Bio-LNG can be certified as having zero or negative well-to-wake emission intensity. Vessel operators  can  account  for  Bio-LNG  with  zero  or  negative well-to-wake emission intensity towards their vessel's GHG intensity reduction target. Therefore, guidance on how to apply calculations  for  Bio-LNG  with  zero  or  negative  well-to-wake  emission  intensity  within  the context of FuelEU is deemed useful.

In  the  context  of  FuelEU,  the E value  is  used,  and  this  value  can  be  negative.  The well-to-tank  GHG  emission  factor  CO 2eq,wtt for  Bio-LNG  will  apply  a  deduction  of  C fCO2 (as stated in Annex II of FuelEU), which will be subtracted from the E value presented in the PoS, yielding:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

This deduction is intended to offset the biogenic CO2 combustion emissions of Bio-LNG, resulting in net-zero emissions from a biogenic carbon perspective.

## 3.4.1 Biomethane examples

The following examples demonstrate how Biomethane with negative or zero well-to-wake GHG intensity, used across different engine types, affects compliance balance and FuelEU penalties.

## Example 1: Vessel uses bio-LNG (-15 gCO2eq/MJ) - DF Otto medium speed

A vessel uses  Bio-LNG  in a  dual-fuel  (DF)  Otto-cycle  medium  speed  engine.  The biomethane was produced from manure. Based on the proof of sustainability (an example value  is  presented  here  for  demonstration  purpose  only, not corresponding to any actual product  nor  any  default  value),  the  following  GHG  emissions  according  to  EU  RED certification are obtained:

During one Reporting Period, the ship in this example consumes:

- 0 metric tons Fossil LNG

- Example 1b (30% Bio-LNG):
- 6,929 metric tons Fossil LNG
- 2,916 metric tons Bio-LNG
- 1,400 tonnes MDO/MGO.

Compliance balance results are presented in Table 27. The amount of Bio-LNG, combined with the consumption  of  other  fuels  (MDO/MGO  and  LNG),  is  sufficient  to  achieve compliance (CB &gt; 0), resulting in a zero FuelEU penalty.

## 3.5. Low-Carbon and Recycled Fuels

In  addition  to  biofuels 86 and  RFNBO/e-fuels, FuelEU also recognizes the following certified fuels towards meeting ship GHG intensity reduction targets:

- Low  Carbon  Fuels  (LCF) :  Derived  from  non-renewable  sources,  including  fossil energy  with  carbon  capture  and  storage  (CCS)  and  nuclear  power  energy,   the

energy content of which is derived from low-carbon hydrogen (from non-renewable sources),  following  the  definition  in  Article  2  of  Directive  (EU)  2024/1788  (Gas Directive).

- Recycled  Carbon  Fuels  (RCF) :  Specific  type  of  low-carbon  fuels  produced  from liquid or solid waste streams of non-renewable origin that are not suitable for material recovery  in  accordance  with  Article  4  of  Directive  2008/98/EC,  or  from  waste processing gas and exhaust gas of non-renewable origin which are produced as an unavoidable and unintentional consequence of industrial production process, following the definition in Article  2  of  Directive  (EU) 2018/2001 (Renewable Energy Directive).

These  fuels  should  be  certified 87   under  a  scheme  recognised  by  the  Commission  in accordance with Article 30(5) and (6) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 or, where applicable, the relevant  provisions  of  Union  legal  acts  concerning  the  internal  markets  in  renewable  and natural gases and in hydrogen.

RCFs are certified according to a methodology for assessing GHG emissions savings, as per Regulation (EU) 2023/1185 supplementing EU RED. An equivalent methodology is still being  drafted  for  LCFs, 88 which  are  defined  as  fuels  with  energy  content  derived  from non-renewable sources.

Nevertheless, calculation guidance within the context of FuelEU is useful to illustrate how calculations  would  be  applied  to  both  RCFs  and  LCFs.  This  guidance  is  based  on  the already  mandated  minimum  greenhouse  gas  emission  reduction  criteria 89 for  both  these classes  of  fuels,  which  require at  least  a  70  %  reduction compared  to  the  fossil  fuel comparator for transport fuels of 94 gCO2eq/MJ. 90  This minimum reduction means that the maximum GHG emission will be stated in a PoS (or equivalent certification document) as a maximum E value GHG emissions of:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Similarly to the RFNBO case, the E value in the PoS document for an RCF or an LCF already includes fuel-in-use (combustion) emissions according to EU RED methodology (note:  this  differs  in  most  cases  from  FuelEU  definition  of  tank-to-wake  emissions).  The E value for RCFs and LCFs is used under FuelEU in a manner equivalent to the calculation examples for RFNBOs/e-fuels (see Section 1.2.4), where E includes a TtW component ' ', 𝑒 𝑢 representing  'emissions from combusting the fuel in its end-use (gCO2eq/MJ fuel)', which

Under  FuelEU Annex I, the calculation 'Methodology for establishing the GHG intensity of the energy used on board by a ship', requires that the well-to-tank GHG emission factor for RFNBOs and RCFs 𝐶𝑂 2𝑒𝑞𝑊𝑡𝑇 (and  by  extension  LCFs,  once  the  methodology  for  GHG  certification  is  in  place)  will necessarily apply a deduction of ' '  ,  to  be  subtracted  from  the E value presented in the 𝑒 𝑢 PoS or equivalent certification document, yielding:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

To avoid erroneously double-counting emissions of the fuel in use, it's important to note that the  GHG  intensity  formula  (Equation  1)  in  FuelEU  Annex  I  already  includes  combustion emissions under tank-to-wake emissions of combusted fuel, ' '. 92 𝐶𝑂 2𝑒𝑞𝑇𝑡𝑊𝑖,𝑗

Additionally, the RFNBO reward factor does not apply to RCF and LCF . This distinction is crucial:  RFNBOs  are  rewarded  with  a  multiplier  of  '2'  applied  to  the  fuel  energy  in  the denominator of GHG intensity (Article 5(1) and Annex I of FuelEU). This reward factor ( RWDi = 2) is  applicable  from  1  January  2025 to 31 December 2033. However, this reward factor does not apply for RCFs and LCFs ,  as  they  are not covered under Article 5, 'Use of Renewable  Fuels  of  Non-Biological  Origin'. 93 Therefore,  an RWDi of  '1'  applies  if  fuel i is certified as an RCF or LCF.

## 3.5.1 Low-carbon and recycled fuels examples

The following examples demonstrate how certified LCF and RCF affect a ship's compliance balance and FuelEU penalties, particularly in the absence of a reward factor multiplier.

## Example 1: Recycled Carbon Fuel (RCF)

A  ship  uses  certified  recycled  carbon  methanol  RCF  methanol,  produced  from  a  solid non-renewable waste stream that is unsuitable for material recovery. 94

Based on the PoS (or an equivalent certification document) provided with the fuel delivery, the  following  GHG emissions are obtained according to EU RED certification, exemplified here with a limit value, i.e., the highest accepted in EU RED: 95

The entire well-to-wake emissions calculation for this fuel is thus (note: here RCF methanol fuel is shown in isolation from all other energy consumed onboard):

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

From here, the calculation steps are the same as in Section 1.2.4, except that the multiplier of 2 as a reward factor for RFNBOs does not apply to RCF methanol in the denominator of GHG intensity calculation.

In this example, the ship consumes the following amounts over the course of 1 year (full year 2025), with the baseline case of consuming only HFO and MDO/MGO given in brackets:

- 11,460 tonnes HFO (baseline: 12 000 tonnes HFO)
- 1,100 tonnes RCF methanol (baseline: 0 tonnes methanol)
- 1,400 tonnes MDO/MGO (baseline: 1400 tonnes MDO/MGO).

Compliance  balance  results  are  presented  in  Table  31.  The  amount  of  RCF  methanol, combined with the consumption of other fuels (HFO and MDO/MGO), is sufficient to achieve compliance (CB = 70 ton CO2eq &gt; 0), resulting in zero FuelEU penalty. It should be noted that the  energy  from  RCF  methanol  is not double  counted  (no  RFNBO  reward  multiplier applicable, RWD = 1). Therefore, the amount of RCF methanol (~1,100 tonnes) required to reach compliance (i.e. a CB of at least 0 or positive) is larger than the amount of e-methanol needed (~400 tonnes of e-methanol, Section 1.4 - Example 6). This is due to two factors: a) No reward factor for RCF methanol ( RWDRCF methanol = 1) and b) The certified GHG emissions ( E value) assumed for RCF methanol ( E = 28.2 gCO2eq/MJ) are higher than those assumed for e-methanol ( E = 5 to 10 gCO2eq/MJ, Section 1.4 - Example 6).

## Example 2: Low Carbon Fuel (LCF), carbon-containing fuel

A ship uses certified low-carbon methanol (LCF methanol), produced from energy sourced from low-carbon hydrogen. In this example, the hydrogen is produced by steam-reforming of natural  gas  with  carbon  capture  and  storage 99   (CCS),  combined  with  a  biogenic  CO 2 source 100 .

geological storage permitted under Directive 2009/31/EC), but instead from a separate carbon source, in this example a biogenic carbon source.

100  Referring to latest draft of Commission Delegated Regulation supplementing Directive (EU) 2024/1788, in this example the captured CO 2 stems from biofuels, bioliquids or biomass fuels complying with the sustainability and greenhouse gas saving criteria set out in Article 29 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001.

From here, the calculation steps are the same as in Section 1.2.4, except that the multiplier of 2 as a reward factor for RFNBOs does not apply to LCF methanol in the denominator of the GHG intensity calculation.

In this example, the ship consumes the following amounts over the course of 1 year (full year 2025), with the baseline case of consuming only HFO and MDO/MGO given in brackets:

- 11,460 tonnes HFO (baseline: 12,000 tonnes HFO)
- 1,100 tonnes LCF methanol (baseline: 0 tonnes methanol)
- 1,400 tonnes MDO/MGO (baseline: 1,400 tonnes MDO/MGO).

Compliance balance results are presented in Table 31. The amount of LCF methanol in this example, combined with the consumption of other fuels (HFO and MDO/MGO), is sufficient to achieve compliance (CB = 70 ton CO2eq &gt; 0), resulting in zero FuelEU penalty. It should be noted  that  the  amount  of  energy  from  LCF  methanol  is not double  counted (no RFNBO reward  multiplier  applicable,  RWD  =  1).  Therefore,  the  amount  of  LCF  methanol  (~1100 tonnes) required to reach compliance (i.e. a CB of at least 0 or positive) is larger than the amount of e-methanol needed (~400 tonnes of e-methanol, Section 1.4 - Example 6). This is due to two factors: a) No reward factor for LCF methanol, RWDLCF methanol =  1,  and  b) The certified  GHG emissions ( E value) assumed for LCF methanol ( E = 28.2 gCO2eq/MJ) are higher than those for e-methanol ( E = 5 to 10 gCO2eq/MJ, Section 1.4 - Example 6).

## Example 3: Low Carbon Fuel (LCF), chemically carbon-free fuel

A ship uses certified low-carbon ammonia (LCF ammonia), produced from energy sourced from low-carbon hydrogen. In this example, the hydrogen is produced by steam-reforming of natural gas with carbon capture and storage (CCS). Note that there is no need for a carbon source in this case, as ammonia does not contain carbon in its chemical composition.

Based on the PoS (or an equivalent certification document) provided with the fuel delivery, the following GHG emissions are obtained according to EU RED certification,  exemplified here with a limit value, i.e., the highest accepted in EU RED 104 :

, 𝐸 (𝐿𝐶𝐹 𝐴𝑚𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑖𝑎)  = 28. 20000 𝑔𝐶𝑂 2 𝑒𝑞/𝑀𝐽

of which: assumed to be . 𝑒 𝑢 (𝐿𝐶𝐹 𝐴𝑚𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑖𝑎) 0 𝑔𝐶𝑂 2 𝑒𝑞/𝑀𝐽

The well-to-tank emissions for this fuel become:

From here, the calculation steps are the same as in Section 1.2.4, except that the multiplier of  2  as  reward  factor  for  RFNBOs  does not apply to LCF ammonia in the denominator of GHG intensity calculation.

- 1,176 tonnes LCF ammonia (baseline: 0 tonnes ammonia)
- 1,400 tonnes MDO/MGO (baseline: 1,400 tonnes MDO/MGO).

Compliance balance results are presented in Table 31. The amount of LCF ammonia in this example, combined with the consumption of other fuels (HFO and MDO/MGO), is sufficient to achieve compliance (CB = 70 ton CO2eq &gt; 0), resulting in zero FuelEU penalty.

## 3.6. Zero-Emission Technologies at Berth (Annex III)

In  addition  to  ship  GHG  intensity  targets  (Article  4),  the  FuelEU  mandates  zero-emission requirements for energy use for all electrical power demand at berth (Article 6) for specific ship types, namely containerships and passenger ships, from 1 January 2030. Specifically, it requires these ships to connect to on-shore power (OPS) when moored for 2 hours or more. One exemption 105  from the obligation to use OPS while moored at the quayside is the use of 'zero-emission  technologies'  (ZET)  that  are  demonstrated  to  be  'equivalent  to the use of OPS', in which case a ship should be exempted from using OPS.

Article 3(7) defines ZET as technologies that, when in use, do not release GHGs (CO 2 , CH4, N2O) or air pollutants (SO x , NOx and particulate matter) into the atmosphere while providing energy to a ship's electrical power demand at berth. Essentially, emissions from using ZET are considered from a tank-to-wake perspective for the purpose of Article 6, zero-emission requirements for energy use for all electrical power demand at berth.

By nature, OPS has zero tank-to-wake emissions, but depending on the electrical production pathway, electricity may be associated with upstream emissions. FuelEU stipulates that OPS should be incentivized by attributing zero upstream emissions (rated as 0 gCO 2 eq/MJ) to all electricity delivered by OPS (Recital (44) and Appendix I).

105 The other exemptions are related to lack of OPS availability, among other exemptions not represented by a direct technological alternative to OPS connection, as is the case for ZETs.

The European Sustainable Shipping Forum (ESSF) provides a platform for structural dialogue, exchange of technical knowledge, cooperation and coordination between the Commission, Member States' authorities and maritime transport stakeholders on issues pertaining to the sustainability and the competitiveness of EU maritime transport. This document has not

As ZET is referred to as an equivalent to OPS (FuelEU Recital 39), one might mistakenly think  that  the  mass  of  the  fuel  used  for  operating  the  ZET  and  its  associated  well-to-tank carbon factor also should be similarly counted as zero, as is the case for OPS.  However, this  is  not  the  case  for  ZET:  the  provisions  of  Article  4  (accounting  for  the  energy  used onboard) should still be complied with, even when using an 'equivalent technology' to OPS. This requirement is substantiated by Article 7, paragraph 2, which states that:

Monitoring and reporting shall be complete and cover the energy used on board by ships at any time, whether at sea or at berth .

It  is  therefore important to note that while Annex I exempts well-to-tank emissions from the use of electricity, no such exemption is mentioned for ZET in Annex I, II or III.

ZETs are listed in a non-exhaustive table in Annex III of the Regulation, along with general requirements for such technologies. This list is expected to be amended by future delegated acts  and  complemented by implementing acts that define detailed criteria for acceptance, including  the  definition  of  system  boundaries  and  certification  requirements  for  ZETs.  The current non-exhaustive list in Annex III includes the following technologies.

## ● Fuel cells using fuels with zero emissions from a tank-to-wake perspective:

Fuels  that  would  have  zero  tank-to-wake  CO2  emissions  include  any  kind  of hydrogen and ammonia (fossil, biofuels, e-fuels) as these fuels contain no carbon. However, it should be noted that ZETs also need to have zero emissions of the other two defined greenhouse gases, N2O and CH4. In practice, this might exclude NH3 as its use in fuel cells produces low amounts of N 2 O, but not zero emissions.

Since fuels used in ZETs form part of the GHG intensity calculation, their upstream production pathway will impact the compliance balance. See Section 3.6.1 Examples 1 and 2 for renewable hydrogen versus fossil hydrogen, respectively.

## ● On-board electrical energy storage:

This  includes  scenarios  such  as  1)  'onboard  power  generation  at  sea',  where onboard  equipment  is used for charging on-board batteries during the voyage,   2) 'shore  side  battery  charging,'  meaning  OPS charging of on-board batteries, or   3) swapping  on-board  batteries  with pre-charged batteries from ashore. All scenarios will have zero tank-to-wake emissions.

Since fuels used in ZETs form part of the GHG intensity calculation, their upstream production  pathway  will  impact  the  compliance  balance.  See examples in Section 3.6.1 for OPS charging of batteries versus onboard generation at sea.

## ● On-board power generation from wind and solar power:

Equipment  directly  connected  to  the  ship's  switchboard  or  charging  as  on-board intermediate electrical energy storage (such as batteries) is eligible as ZET, provided it supplies enough power to meet the ship's electrical  demand at berth.

This document has not

Since  no  fuel  consumption  is  involved,  this  technology  is  treated  as  equivalent  to using  OPS,  with  a  zero  GHG  intensity  contribution  (0  g  CO 2 eq/MJ)  to  the  GHG intensity  of  the  energy  used  on  board  by  a  ship  (Article  4  and  Annex  I).  However, because the energy is generated onboard, it does not fall under the scope of Annex I definition  of ,  'Electricity  delivered  to  the  ship  per  OPS  connection  point k [MJ].' 𝐸 𝑘

Calculation  examples  on  the  effect  of  onboard  power  generation  on  the  ship's compliance  balance  are  provided  below,  including  example  3.5.0  (baseline  case using OPS) and example 3.5.5 (using onboard power generation from wind and solar power).

As mentioned, the list of ZETs  identified in Annex III may be expanded when delegated acts under Article 6(6) are adopted and regularly updated by the Commission. Amendments and additions to this list may require an update of this section showcasing calculation examples.

## 3.6.1 Zero-emission technology examples

The following examples illustrate how different zero emission technologies used at berth, ranging from OPS alternatives to onboard renewable generation, impact a ship's FuelEU compliance balance, GHG intensity, and potential penalties.

Note  on  assumptions: When  reading  the  following  ZET  examples,  the  following assumptions were made to calculate the results.

- GWP : In these examples, it is assumed that GWP values for CH4 and N2O follow IPCC AR5 values, which are expected to be adopted in FuelEU by the time of this example scenario (2030-2034).

## Example 1: Base case with OPS

In  this  example,  a  ship  consumes  the  following  annual  amount  of  fuels  and  OPS in the Reporting Period 2030 (the first year of mandatory connection to OPS for passenger ships and containerships), all intra-EU (i.e., all port calls and voyages within FuelEU scope):

- 11,578 tonnes HFO;
- 1,400 tonnes MGO/MDO;
- Ek = 4.75 GWh = 17,100,000 MJ OPS, as per electricity delivery notes.

Results  in  Table  32  show  achieved  GHG  intensity,  compliance  balance,  and  resulting FuelEU penalty. (see step-by-step compliance balance instructions in Section 1.3).

The  selected  fuel  and  OPS  energy  consumption  lead  to  a  compliant  year  for  Reporting Periods 2025-2029. However, since the OPS requirements do not fully enter into force until 2030, the period 2030-2034 has been chosen to better reflect a scenario with the 2030 OPS mandate.  It  should be noted however that this does not exclude the voluntary application (and benefits) of implementing and reporting OPS and ZETs already before 2030.

For the base case scenario with fossil fuels and OPS, an actual GHG intensity of 88.63 g/MJ is  achieved.  For  the  period  2030-2034,  the  required  GHG intensity value is lower than the achieved GHG intensity, at 85.69 g/MJ, which means that the base case scenario results in a compliance deficit of 1,602 tonnes, equivalent to a penalty of approximately € 1.1 million.

Throughout  Examples  2  through  6,  this  base  case  scenario  is used as the reference for comparison.

## Example 2: 100% fossil-based hydrogen used in fuel cells to replace OPS

Earlier, it was defined for the purpose of illustrating the compliance balance calculations that the port stay energy demand for the chosen ship over one year is 4.75 GWh of electrical energy.  This  electrical  energy  demand  can  be  converted  into  a  corresponding fuel mass using  the  lower  calorific  value  and  the  energy  converter's  efficiency  as  follows  (same nomenclature and units as FuelEU):

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where ηj is  the  energy  efficiency  of  the  energy  converter j , is  the  shore  power 𝐸 𝑘 energy delivered to the ship, in MJ, and is the lower calorific value of the fuel, in 𝐿𝐶𝑉 𝑖 MJ/g.

The European Sustainable Shipping Forum (ESSF) provides a platform for structural dialogue, exchange of technical knowledge, cooperation and coordination between the Commission, Member States' authorities and maritime transport stakeholders on issues pertaining to the sustainability and the competitiveness of EU maritime transport. This document has not

This equation is generic for any kind of fuel, but it will be used for hydrogen in this example. It  is  assumed  in  this  example  that  fuel  cells  would  have  a  fuel  conversion  efficiency  into electricity  of  50%  (η j =0.5).  Using the lower calorific value provided in FuelEU for hydrogen (0.120  MJ/g)  and  the  chosen Ek value  of  4.75 GWh = 17,100,000 MJ, the corresponding mass  of  hydrogen  to be used in a fuel cell system would be 285 tonnes. This amount is independent of the production pathway of the hydrogen.

Using this value in the FuelEU calculation for compliance balance and comparing it with the OPS base case, it is found that the CO2eq compliance deficit is increased by approximately 3,049 tonnes, leading to more than double the penalty, from approximately €1.1 million to approximately  €2.9  million.  The  GHG  intensity  for  the  ship  in  this  operational  scenario  is 93.95 gCO2eq/MJ, of which the contribution of fossil hydrogen is based on default FuelEU emission factor of 132 gCO2eq/MJ WtW for H2 (natural gas) - Fuel Cells, which moves the GHG intensity of the ship further above the FuelEU GHG intensity target compared to the base case of using OPS (see Table 32). This is due to the upstream emissions of the fossil production pathway of hydrogen, which should thus be taken into account in the calculation according  to  default  FuelEU  emission factors for fossil fuels (Annex II of the Regulation). Furthermore, the impact on GHG intensity also results from the fact that fuels are weighted by their chemical energy content, typically higher than that of electricity, while OPS provides electrical  energy,  which  is  rated  as  zero  in  the  numerator  of  the  GHG  intensity  formula. Therefore, removal of OPS is affecting both the numerator and the denominator of the GHG intensity equation.

## Example 3: 100% RFNBO hydrogen used in fuel cells to replace OPS

This  example  does  not  differ  from  Example  1  in  terms  of  equipment  and  consumption patterns, assuming the same amounts of hydrogen energy used in fuel cells to replace the use  of  OPS.  The  only  difference  lies  in  the  upstream  emissions  associated  with  the production  pathway  of  the  fuel.  FuelEU  Annex  II  does  not  provide  the  default  value  for RFNBO hydrogen upstream emissions. However, for this example, it is assumed to be 10 gCO2eq/MJ, based on hypothetical GHG emissions in an accepted fuel certificate (PoS or equivalent certificate) accompanying the bunker delivery note of hydrogen to the ship.

Again,  the  4.75  GWh  corresponds  to  the  same  amount  of  285  tonnes  of  hydrogen  as demonstrated  in  Example  1  above.  However,  using  a  lower-GHG  upstream  emission hydrogen  and  comparing  it  with  the  OPS  baseline,  it  is  found  that  the  CO 2eq compliance deficit  using  OPS  is  reversed  to  a  compliance surplus of  2,312  tonnes,  resulting  in  a difference in the compliance balance of +3,913 tonnes.

The  GHG  intensity  for  this  scenario  is  81.58  gCO 2 eq/MJ  which  is  lower  than  the  GHG intensity target and better than the baseline with OPS. Because the GHG intensity target is met,  there  will  be  no  penalty  for  this  scenario  in  2030  (see  Table  32).  This  improvement compared to the base case is explained by the fact that more energy (of low-GHG intensity) is required to produce the OPS corresponding amount of electricity using fuel cells; in other words, this energy of low GHG intensity exceeds Ek .

## Example 4: Using OPS and charging batteries

This  example  assumes  that  for  half  of  the  yearly  port  stays  (assuming  all  port  stays  last equally long), the ship will receive OPS delivery corresponding to the hotel load demand plus additional  OPS  delivery  to  charge  installed  batteries.  These  batteries  will  be  used  later during the other half of the yearly port stays where OPS is also required. This means the ship uses OPS for half of its port stays and  ZET in the form of pre-charged batteries for the other half. Ports are not obliged to deliver more energy than what corresponds to the ship's hotel load per port stay, so ships should be cautious of using this scenario as a compliance strategy.

Due to the charging and discharging of batteries, there will be an energy loss, leading to an increase in energy demand with this strategy. The total energy needed can be expressed using the equation below, where 'portsA' represents half the OPS required during port stays, charging  somewhat  more  than  double  the  energy  demand,  accounting  for  the  energy efficiency penalty for energy storage in batteries, ηB :

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where, Ed portsA , represents the OPS energy demand for the port stays in ports A,

Ed portsB , represents the energy demand from ZET for the port stays of ports B , and

ηB , is the overall energy efficiency of battery storage (charging and discharging).

Using this equation and assuming that ηB is  0.75, 106   the  amount of OPS that needs to be delivered to the ship in ports A is 5.54 GWh, instead of the base case Ek of 4.75 GWh.

Using 5.54 GWh as OPS yearly consumption in the FuelEU compliance balance calculation and  comparing it with the OPS base case, it is found that the CO2eq compliance deficit is lowered by 244 tonnes, due to the increased amount of low-GHG energy required for OPS charging of batteries as ZET at berth, as a result of losses in battery charging/discharging. However, this reduction is not sufficient to reach the GHG intensity target. The ship's GHG intensity  for  this  scenario  is  88.16  gCO 2 eq/MJ, which is still higher than the GHG intensity target  of  85.60  gCO 2 eq/MJ,  but  better  than  the  baseline  case  with  OPS.  Again,  this improvement is due to the increased amount of low-GHG energy required for OPS charging of batteries as ZET at berth, as a result of losses in battery charging/discharging (see Table 32).

## Example  5:  Charging  batteries  while  at  sea  with  additional  fuel  on  onboard generators for utilisation of battery power at berth

This scenario provides zero emissions at berth but will result in increased fuel consumption while at sea. It considers using MGO as fuel in generators or auxiliary engines to charge batteries with enough electricity to cover the electrical demand at berth, without considering low-GHG  intensity  fuels  in  those generators. This example demonstrates how a ZET can work  against  achieving  the  GHG  intensity  target.  If  a  lower  GHG  intensity  fuel,  such  as bio-diesel,  were  used instead of MGO, the 2030 GHG intensity target would likely be met. Note that the current scenario does not consider the possibility in some vessels to charge the batteries by shaft generators / Power Take Out (PTO) connected to main engines, which would also be more efficient than auxiliary engines.

For the energy conversion into the mass of fuel, the specific fuel oil consumption (SFOC) of an  auxiliary  engine  is   utilized,  as  this  provides  a  conservative  case  compared  to  PTO. Besides the propulsion power conversion efficiency, which is included in the SFOC factor, the energy efficiency of battery storage (charging and discharging losses) also needs to be considered  ( ηB) .  Hence,  the  mass  of  fuel  can  be  found  using  the  equation  below  (same nomenclature and units as FuelEU):

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

SFOCi,j is assumed to be 200 g/kWh 107  of MGO and the energy storage efficiency of batteries, ηB , is assumed to be 0.75. 108 Therefore, the 4.75 GWh of electrical energy from OPS corresponds to 1,267 tonnes of MGO when generating electricity at sea for storing in batteries and utilization as ZET at berth.

In this scenario of charging batteries at sea with fossil MGO, the GHG intensity results in 91.41 gCO2eq/MJ, which is well above the GHG intensity target for 2030 and also higher than the base case of using OPS at berth. This results in a penalty of approximately €2.1 million, about double compared to OPS baseline case. The total CO2eq compliance deficit is 3,334 tonnes, which is worse than the OPS base case by 1,733 tonnes. However, it should be noted that if another fuel, such as drop-in bio-diesel, had been used at sea to charge the batteries, the vessel would probably reach the GHG intensity target with zero FuelEU penalty.

## Example 6: Solar and/or wind generated electricity while in port

This scenario assumes that a ship can generate enough direct electricity using solar power and/or wind power while in port. Although this scenario might not be the most realistic as it does not include the use of batteries, it provides valuable insights into the consequences of such  choice  in  terms  of  FuelEU  GHG  intensity  and  compliance  balance.  Generating electricity at sea would require battery installation, which would come with respective energy losses.

Since only the electricity source from OPS, Ek ,  can  be  included in the FuelEU calculation, electricity  generated  onboard  from  solar  or  wind  will  not  positively  impact  a  ship's  GHG intensity calculation. Instead, it reduces the amount of energy reported, reducing M i and Ek in the compliance balance formula of Annex IV.

In  this  example,  the  GHG  intensity  for  the  scenario  of  onboard  solar/wind  generation  of electricity is   91.49 g/MJ, which is above the GHG intensity target for 2030 and higher than the baseline case. This results in a penalty of approximately €2 million, almost double of the OPS  baseline  case.  The  total  CO 2eq compliance  deficit  is  3,067  tonnes,  which  is  1,465 tonnes worse than the OPS baseline case.

## 3.6.2 Conclusion for Annex III zero emission technologies at berth

Where a ship is required to use OPS per FuelEU Article 6, the only other options to substitute OPS to meet or exceed compliance in terms of GHG intensity targets is by using renewable or other low-GHG fuel in fuel cells, or using low-GHG intensity fuels (e.g., bio-diesel) in onboard generators or shaft generators for charging batteries (note this example is not provided in this document).

To allow for comparability across the examples in this chapter, the same energy demand and fuel types as in the base case are used. As the OPS requirement for passenger and container ships begins on 1 January 2030, that year is used as the reference, unlike Chapter 1, which uses 2025-2029. In most examples, OPS or fossil-based ZET alone at berth is not sufficient to meet the GHG intensity target. This demonstrates that the main contributor to compliance is typically the choice of fuels used at sea.

It should be noted that, provided there is no change in other fuels used at sea, only the ZET example of fuel cells with RFNBO-hydrogen lead to compliance with the GHG intensity target in the year 2030. This result would change in 2035 when a lower GHG intensity target is mandated. In this case, even fuel cells with RFNBO-hydrogen would not meet the 2035 GHG targets.

## 4. Chapter 4: Flexibility Mechanisms

## 4.1. Introduction

The compliance balance for the Reporting Period is calculated using the formula set out in FuelEU  Annex  IV  Part A, based on the GHGIE actual 109  derived from the FuelEU Report data. 110  Compliance balances can be positive, negative, or zero. The regulation is designed to  incentivize  companies  to  achieve  a  compliance  balance  below  the  GHGIE  target established  in  FuelEU  Article  4.  To  support  compliance,  the  FuelEU  provides  flexibility mechanisms.

Flexibility  mechanisms  create  an  alternative  compliance  option  for  ships  with  a  FuelEU deficit  and  support  the  deployment  of  the  most  advanced  solutions  for  ships  with  a compliance surplus. The mechanism aims to create a virtuous cycle, incentivizing the lowest GHG intensity technologies and accelerating the uptake of such technologies in the maritime industry.

## 4.2. Key Concepts and Definitions

FuelEU Articles 20 and 21 define three flexibility options, which are described below.

1. Banking: is a compliance  option that allows companies  to  accumulate  the over-performance of one ship in terms of compliance balance over the years. This accumulated  surplus  can  be  used  in  subsequent  years  to  offset  deficits  of  that specific ship or other ships through the pooling mechanism.; or
2. Borrowing: is  a  compliance  option  that  allows  companies  to  borrow an Advance Compliance  Surplus from the following year, with the obligation to repay it with an additional 10% in the next period; or
3. Pooling: to avoid technology lock-in and continue supporting the deployment of the most performant solutions, companies are allowed to pool the compliance balance of ships.  This  means  using  the  over-compliance (surpluses) of one or more ships to compensate for the under-compliance (deficits) of other ships, provided that the total pooled  compliance  is  positive.  As  with  all  flexibility  mechanisms,  the  possibility  to pool compliance is voluntary and requires prior agreements between the participating companies.

Below is a list of definitions used throughout this Chapter.

- Adjusted Compliance Balance Year N (Adjusted CB Year N) [gCO2eq]: The sum of the  Initial  Compliance  Balance  Year  N  plus  the  Banked  Surplus  from  previous periods,  minus  the  Aggravated  Advance  Compliance  Surplus  Year  N-1  from  the previous Reporting Period Year N-1. It can be positive, negative or zero. Calculated by 31 March of the Verification Period Year N+1.

109  For more information, see Chapter 1, section 1.2 on GHGIE actual calculations

110 The FuelEU Report is a ship-specific compliance report required under Article 15(3) of the FuelEU. It must be submitted annually by 31 January to the verifier and contains all the monitored and recorded data specified in Article 15(1).

- Advance  Compliance  Surplus  Year  N (ACS  Year  N)  [gCO 2 eq]:  The  amount  a company borrows under the Borrowing compliance option during Verification Period Year N+1, ensuring that the Verified Compliance Balance is zero.
- Aggravated  Advance  Compliance  Surplus  Year  N (Aggravated  ACS  Year  N) [gCO2eq]: The ACS aggravated by 10%, to be repaid in the following period. It has to be considered in the Adjusted CB Year N+1 calculations.
- Associated  Administering  State : The  Administering State  linked  to  an  ISM company. It is responsible for calculating penalties in cases of negative compliance balance  or  non-compliant  Port  Calls  (under  FuelEU  Article  6,  which  from  2030 mandates  connection  to  Onshore  Power  Supply  (OPS)  at  berth).  It  also  has  the authority to oversee the full compliance process for all ships associated with that ISM company.
- Banked  Surplus  Year  N [gCO2eq]:  The  positive  Amount  of  Verified  Compliance Balance Year N that can be stored in the THETIS MRV system for a certain ship.
- Compliance  Deficit  Year  N [gCO2eq]:  A  negative  amount of Verified Compliance Balance Year N.
- Flexibility  Mechanism : Pooling, Borrowing,  and  Banking  mechanisms  in  the FuelEU. Using flexibility mechanisms starts on 1 April and ends on 30 April of each Verification Period year N+1.
- FuelEU Document of Compliance (DoC): A document specific to a ship, issued to a  company  by  a  verifier,  which  confirms  that  that  ship  has  complied  with  this Regulation for a specific Reporting Period;
- Initial  Compliance Balance Year N (Initial  CB  Year  N) [gCO2eq]: The Compliance Balance of   Reporting Period Year N, calculated as defined in Part A, Annex IV of FuelEU (see Figure 5). It can be positive, negative or zero.
- ISM Company: Refers to the shipowner or any other organisation or person, such as the  manager  or  the  bareboat  charterer,  that  has  assumed  responsibility  for  the operation of the ship from the shipowner and that, on assuming such responsibility, has agreed  to take over all the duties and  responsibilities  imposed  by  the International  Management  Code  for  the  Safe  Operation  of Ships and for Pollution Prevention as implemented within the Union by Regulation (EC) No 336/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council.
- Pooled  Surplus  Year  N [gCO2eq]:  A  positive  Amount  of  Verified  Compliance Balance Year N, generated by a pool, that can be stored as Banked Surplus in the THETIS MRV system for a certain ship.
- Verified Compliance Balance Year N [gCO2eq]: The final Compliance Balance Year N, calculated after the flexibility mechanism during Verification Period Year N+1. If it is  positive  or equal to zero, the Verifier can issue a Document of Compliance to the ship.  If  it  is  negative,  the  Associated  Administering  State  calculates  the  related Penalty and issues the Document of Compliance once the penalties are paid.

## 4.3. Borrowing

## 4.3.1. Guidance on borrowing compliance

Borrowing,  as  defined  above,  is  a  compliance  option  that  allows  companies  to borrow a certain  amount  of  compliance  balance  (referred  to  as  'Advance  Compliance  Surplus'  in FuelEU) to compensate for a deficit in the Adjusted Compliance Balance of the Reporting Period Year N, calculated during Verification Period Year N+1. Borrowing is always meant to be from the following year, i.e., Reporting Period Year N+1.

Companies should repay this amount with an aggravation of 10% (the Aggravated Advance Compliance Surplus, see Section 4.3.2) in the next period, deducting it from the Adjusted Compliance Balance Year N+1, as stated in Article 20 of FuelEU.

## Requirements

The Advance Compliance Surplus may not be:

- borrowed for two consecutive Reporting Periods; or
- borrowed for an amount exceeding 2% of the greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity target of  Reporting  Period  Year  N,  multiplied  by  the  ship's  energy  consumption,  as calculated in accordance with FuelEU Annex I.

## Timeline and responsibilities

Borrowing  is  possible  during  the  Verification  Period  Year  N+1,  after  the  issuance  of  the Adjusted Compliance Balance and before 30 April of the Verification Period Year N+1. The ISM  company  is  responsible  for  requesting  borrowing  in THETIS MRV system, while the Verifier  is  responsible  for  assessing  and  verifying  the  requested  and  correct  amount to be borrowed.

## Rules and formulas

The Superior Advance Compliance Balance limit is calculated as follows:

The GHGIE target Year N to be considered for the calculation of the Advance Compliance Surplus  is  the one  related  to  the  Reporting Period (Year N) . Year N in  the  calculation refers to  the Reporting  Period .  For  example,  during  the  calculation  of  the  Adjusted Compliance Balance for Year 2029, which occurs during the Verification Period in Year 2030, the GHGIE target will be the 2029 GHGIE target. This remains true even though the GHGIE target changes between the Reporting and Verification Periods from 2% to 6 % reduction of the  reference  value  91.16  gCO 2 eq/MJ,  changing  from  89.33680  gCO2eq/MJ  in  2029  to 85.69040  gCO2eq/MJ  in  2030).  Therefore, the  GHGIE  target  for  Year  2029  to  be considered  for  the  calculation of the ACB Year N limit will be 89.33680 gCO2eq/MJ , even  if  the  ship  is  actually  borrowing  from  the  following  period  (2030),  where  the  GHGIE target is 85.6904 gCO2eq/MJ.

With  the  example  of 15,000 MJ of energy in scope, below is the calculation of maximum ACS for  Reporting Periods 2029 and 2030:

As defined in Annex-I, Question A.20, 111  the Advance Compliance Surplus borrowed from the next  Reporting  Period  should exactly match the amount corresponding to the compliance deficit  calculated.  Therefore, borrowing  is  not  possible  if  the  Adjusted  Compliance Balance of the Reporting Period Year N exceeds 2% x ( GHGIE target Year N) x Energy consumption :

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Borrowing during a Verification Period prevents a company from joining a Pool during the same Verification Period. Nevertheless, if a company borrowed during a Verification Period, it  is  still  possible  to  join  a  pool  during  the  following  year,  even  if  the  ship's  compliance balance is affected by the resulting Aggravated Advance Compliance Surplus.

Lastly,  it  is  important  to  highlight  what  happens  in  the  event  of  no EU port calls for a ship which applied for borrowing in the previous year. The ISM company will be notified by the associated Administering State of the amount of the FuelEU penalty according to the Article 20(4):

where a ship does not have any port call in the Union during the Reporting Period and borrowed an advance compliance surplus in the previous Reporting Period, the competent authority of the administering State shall notify by 1 June of the Verification Period to the company concerned the amount of the FuelEU penalty as referred to in Article 23(2) that it

initially  avoided  by  means  of  borrowing  that  advance compliance surplus, multiplied by 1.1 .

## 4.3.2. Definition of the aggravated advance compliance surplus

Starting with the calculation of the GHG Intensity target of the Energy used on board, namely GHGIE target Year N:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The Initial  Compliance Balance of Year N (ICB  Year  N)  is  calculated  during  Verification Period Year N+1 and refers to the ship's energy performance during the Reporting Period Year N, using relevant input data (e.g., fuel consumption, GHGIE target Year N). It considers the difference between the GHGIE target for Year N and the actual GHGIE for Year N, as shown in the examples in Section 1.4. The Initial Compliance Balance formula is:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The Adjusted  Compliance  Balance  of  Year  N (ACB  Year  N)  considers  the Previous Banked  Surplus (PBS  Year  (N-1))  stored  in  the  previous  period  Year  N-1  and  the Aggravated  Advance  Compliance  Surplus  (Aggravated ACS Year N-1) ,  which  is  10% more of the Advance Compliance Surplus, coming from the previous period if borrowed.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The  Aggravated  ACS  Year  (N-1)  is  equal  to  zero  if  the  company  decided  not  to  opt for borrowing during Year N-1. If this applies and if the Adjusted Compliance Balance Year N is less  than  2% x GHGIE target Year N x Energy in Scope, companies are entitled to opt for Borrowing in the event of a negative Adjusted Compliance Balance of Year N.

Before  31  March  of  the  Verification  Period  Year  N+1,  verifiers  calculate  the  Adjusted Compliance  Balance  Year  N,  considering  the  input  data  (e.g.,  fuel  consumption,  GHGIE target Year N) of the Reporting Period Year N. When the flexibility mechanism starts during Verification  Period  Year  N+1,  if  a  company  chooses  to  opt  for  borrowing,  the Advance Compliance Surplus Year N has to be calculated.

The Advance Compliance Surplus Year N (ACS Year N) to be borrowed during Verification Period Year N+1 has a maximum limit equal to 2% of the GHGIE target Year N multiplied by the energy in scope of FuelEU for Reporting Period Year N.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The Aggravated ACB Year N will have to be deducted from the Initial Compliance Balance Year N+1 of Reporting Period Year N+1 (Aggravated ACS Year N).

Figure 6 shows an example describing borrowing compliance options from 2025 through 2050. Please note that this is an illustrative example and based on two important assumptions in this case:

1. No Pooling occurs, and no Banked Surplus comes from Pooling.
2. When possible, ships always opt to Borrow. They could choose not to borrow but for explanatory purposes, we are assuming they always do.

## 4.4. Banking

## 4.4.1. Guidance on banking compliance

After  calculating  the Adjusted  Compliance  Balance  for  Year  N during  the  Verification Period Year N+1, ships may either have a deficit or a surplus. Ships can then join a pool (see Section 4.5) to reduce or cancel their deficits or to pass on their surplus. Once a ship exits a pool, it may have a surplus or a remaining deficit (but not a higher one). Surplus can be banked according to FuelEU Article 20(1).

## Requirements for banking a surplus

ISM companies are allowed to bank only if the Verified Compliance Balance of Year N is positive .

In the event of a surplus of the Adjusted Compliance Balance, the company may choose to directly bank the surplus in THETIS MRV IT system, pool the surplus or opt not to bank. The decision not to bank may occur if, for example, the company participates in a voluntary GHG emission reduction scheme with additionality restrictions. On the other hand, in the event of a deficit of the Adjusted Compliance Balance, the company may join a pool (and exit with a reduced  deficit  or  a  surplus  from  it)  or  decide  not  to  join  a  pool  and  immediately  pay  the penalties.

Ultimately, once the Verified Compliance Balance Year N is assessed by the Verifier and if it is positive , the ISM company again may bank this surplus or opt not to bank .

## Timeline and responsibilities

In the event of a surplus resulting from a positive Verified Compliance Balance, whether from a  pooling  mechanism  or  over-compliant  energy  performance,  companies  are  entitled  to register the surplus as Banked Surplus in THETIS MRV . This has to be done by the ISM company  after  the  calculation  and  assessment of the Verified Compliance Balance by its Verifier and before 30 June of the Verification Period Year N+1 . The Verifier then needs to confirm and accept the amount of banked surplus in THETIS MRV. It is important to note that once the FuelEU DoC is issued by the Verifier, it will no longer be possible to register the surplus in THETIS MRV .

## Rules for banking a Surplus

Banked  surpluses  are  cumulative  and  can be used in all subsequent Verification Periods without any expiration limitations. It is also possible to use banked surpluses from previous Reporting Periods in a compliance pool in future periods, as these surpluses are added to the Adjusted Compliance Balance calculations.

As previously explained, ships with a surplus may choose not to bank or pool, but instead to cancel the surplus. In such cases, the Compliance Balance for that Verification Period will be zero,  and no penalties will be incurred. In addition, for auditing   and tracking purposes, it would be appropriate for verifiers to issue a receipt or a certificate in the event of a surplus not banked.

## 4.5. Pooling

## 4.5.1. Guidance on pooling compliance

Pooling is a compliance option that allows companies to compensate for the under-performance (deficit) of one or more ships with the over-performance (surplus) of one or  more  ships  from  one  or  more  ISM  companies.  The  exchange  of  Pooling  Compliance Balance quotas (in tonnes CO2eq) is a linear and direct exchange among a pool of ships, not a weighted average. According to ISM Companies private agreements, ships will 'sell and/or buy' their surplus and/or deficits of Adjusted Compliance Balances, initially calculated as per FuelEU Annex IV Part A.

## Requirements

The requirements for a pool to be valid are:

1. The ship is within the scope of FuelEU: ships above 5,000 GT and that carry cargo or passengers, with at least one EEA port call in one Reporting Period from 2025, are in scope of FuelEU;
2. The ship has not borrowed compliance in the current Verification Period;
3. The ship is not included in another pool of Compliance Balance for GHG intensity;
4. The sum of the initial Compliance Balance of the ships included in the pool is positive or zero (including banking and borrowing of previous periods);
5. Ships in the pool must possess a valid FuelEU DoC from the most recent Verification Period during which they were within the scope of FuelEU.

## Timeline and responsibilities

One ISM Company (from now on the "Starter Company") with responsibility with one or more vessels which intends to trigger a pooling, first needs to identify the ships to be included in the pool.  Secondly, the Starter Company proposes, after concluding private agreements among the companies,  the  allocation  of  compliance  balances.  Then  all  ISM  Companies  involved  in  the pooling arrangement should accept or reject the allocation proposed.

The Starter Company identifies a Unique Verifier, who could be different from the verifiers that  calculated  the  adjusted  Compliance  Balances  for  each  ship  before  31  March of the Verification  Period.  This  Unique  Verifier  has  to  assess  and  verify  the  final  outcome  of  the pooling arrangement.

Once a ship exits a pool, it cannot borrow, participate in other pools, or accumulate more surplus. Below a simple timeline of a pooling option.

Figure 8. Timeline and responsibilities

<!-- image -->

## Rules for the allocation of Compliance Balances

There are essentially two main rules for pooling allocation:

- A ship that enters the pool with a deficit may not exit with an increased deficit.
- A ship that enters a pool with a positive or zero compliance balance may not exit with a deficit.

It is possible that all ships in the executed pool exit with compliance balances equal to zero or with a surplus. However, due to Requirement 4 (see above) which states that the sum of compliance balances should be zero or positive, it is also possible for ships to exit the pool with a deficit, provided that the total compliance balance is zero or positive and the deficit is not greater than the ship's initial deficit (see Table 33).

It  is  also  possible  to  join  a  pool  where  all  ships  are  already compliant (i.e., all compliance balances  are  positive),  to  simply  exchange  surplus  among  ships  and  reallocate  the compliance balances.

Table 33. Pooling Examples with Alternative Allocations

| Ships   |   Adjusted Compliance Balance | Allocation Alternative 1   | Allocation Alternative 2   |
|---------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Ship A  |                           200 | Verified CB1 = 30 (-170)   | Verified CB1 = 105 (-95)   |
| Ship B  |                           -30 | Verified CB2 = 0 (+30)     | Verified CB2 = 0 (+30)     |
| Ship C  |                           -50 | Verified CB3 = 0 (+50)     | Verified CB3 = 0 (+50)     |
| Ship D  |                            10 | Verified CB4 = 0 (-10)     | Verified CB4 = 5 (-5)      |
| Ship E  |                          -100 | Verified CB5 = 0 (+100)    | Verified CB5 = -80 (+20)   |
| Sum     |                            30 | 30                         | 30                         |

In  Allocation  Alternative  1,  Ship  A  and  D  have  shared  surplus  so that all ships in the pool have a positive compliance balance. In Allocation Alternative 2, the sum of the compliance balances for all ships is positive but Ship E exits the pool with a remaining deficit less than the pre-pool deficit.  Both  allocations  are allowed within the boundaries of the requirements and rules (along with numerous other options). Please note that in Allocation Alternative 2, Ship  E  will  have  a  negative  Verified  Compliance Balance equal to -80, meaning the ISM company of Ship E will be required to pay a penalty.

## Ships with residual Banked surpluses or Borrowing Deficits, without EEA port calls in Year N

If there are no EEA port calls during a certain Reporting Period Year N, a ship that was in scope during a previous Reporting Period from 2025, with a residual Banked Surplus or with a Borrowing Deficit (Aggravated Advance Compliance Surplus), can join a pool during the related Verification Period Year N+1.

Therefore, such a ship can:

- Use its residual Banked Surplus to join a pool and potentially monetize surpluses, or
- Compensate for its residual Borrowing Deficit by joining a Pool.

This  is  also  true  when  the  ship  does  not  have  EEA  port  calls  in  the  following  Reporting Period.

## 4.5.2. Revisions of compliance balance by administering states and additional checks

Administering States may, at any time, conduct additional checks on the entire compliance process  under  FuelEU  for  the  two  previous  Reporting  Periods.  This  could  lead  to  the detection of incorrect Adjusted Compliance Balances, which would affect previous pools. In such  cases,  it  would  mean  that  certain  requirements  for  the  validity  of  those  pools  were mistakenly considered fulfilled.

The European Sustainable Shipping Forum (ESSF) provides a platform for structural dialogue, exchange of technical knowledge, cooperation and coordination between the Commission, Member States' authorities and maritime transport stakeholders on issues pertaining to the sustainability and the competitiveness of EU maritime transport. This document has not

If  an  Administering  State  detects  an  error  in  compliance  balance,  FuelEU  Article  17(4) provides that the company responsible for the error will be notified of this and, if a negative compliance  balance  results,  the  company  in  question  should  pay  a  penalty  equal  to the related amount in Euros to resolve the inconsistency.

If  an  Administering  State  detects  such  an  error  in  the  Compliance  Balance  of  a  ship  that joined a pool , this ship will have to revise its final Verified Compliance Balance for that year and  eventually  pay  a  penalty  if  its  compliance  balance  ends  up  being  negative  in  that Reporting Period.

It is important to note that such a correction may also retroactively invalidate the pool. A pool is  deemed  invalid  if,  following  an  additional  check  by  an  Administering  State,  both  of  the following conditions are met:

1. One  or  more  ships  have  to  consider  a  lower  Adjusted  Compliance  Balance for a specific previous Verification Period; and
2. One  or  more  of  these ships joined a pool in previous Verification Periods and the initial  sum  of  the  Adjusted  Compliance  Balances  is  now  negative,  after  these additional checks.

Specifically, the above situation does not satisfy Requirement 4 (See Section 4.5.1, the sum of  the  initial  Compliance  Balance  of  the  ships  in  the  pool  is  not  positive or zero, including banking and borrowing from previous periods). The outcome of the pool remains valid for the other ships not affected directly by the findings of the additional checks. This ensures that other ships, without errors in their Adjusted Compliance Balances, are not impacted by this additional check. The ship(s) identified as having an error will have their Verified Compliance Balances revised accordingly and will incur a penalty to the extent their revised pool-allocation Verified Compliance Balances are negative, i.e., taking into account that the already allocated compliance to other ships in the pool remains unchanged.

Regardless of whether the ship participated in a pool or not, a new FuelEU DoC should be issued  by  the  Administering  State  whenever  an  Additional  Check  results  in  a  downward revision  of  the  Adjusted  Compliance  Balance.  The  new  DoC  should  not  have  a  longer validity than the DoC held at the time of the Additional Check and, in any case, should expire at the next regular DoC issuance deadline for the subsequent Verification Period.

Consider  the  following  Example  in  Table  34.  The  initial  compliance  balance sum was 25 tCO2eq for this pool of five ships. After an additional check conducted within two years by Administering  State  X  on  Ship  A,  an  error  was  found  in  the  calculations  of  its  Adjusted Compliance  Balance,  which  should  have  been  95,  not  150 tCO2eq. Pooling should have been invalid because the initial sum would have been negative (in this case -30), but pooling still took place.

Therefore,  the  pool's  outcome  is  considered  frozen.  Only  ship  A  is  impacted  by  the additional  check  of  Member  State  X.  In  this  case,  since  the  revised  Verified  Compliance Balance  for  Ship  A  is  negative,  a  penalty  is  calculated  with  a  compliance  balance  of  -30

## 4.6. Timeline and Workflow

The following outlines the timeline and possible pathways from the submission of the FuelEU Report  by  the  ISM  company  to  the  issuance  of  the  FuelEU  DoC  by  the  verifier  or administering authority. It covers key elements of the compliance process, including:

- The ship's Adjusted Compliance Balance (ACB) , which may be positive or negative;
- The application of flexibility mechanisms (such as banking, borrowing, and pooling);
- The calculation of penalties where applicable;
- The determination of the Verified Compliance Balance (VCB) ; and
- The final issuance of the DoC , including any reissuance due to Additional Checks or errors.

Each  step  represents  a  potential  outcome  or  action  depending  on  the ship's compliance performance and the data reported and verified during the annual reporting cycle.
